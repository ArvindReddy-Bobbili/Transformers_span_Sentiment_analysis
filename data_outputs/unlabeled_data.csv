"It would make too much sense to make the spacebar a split-button that can be pressed on either side of the curve, but for some reason Microsoft doesn't always deal in common sense",spacebar
"(My thumbs naturally fall on the far ends of the spacebar, not the center",spacebar
"I have added a weak spring to the right side under the spacebar and that has helped quite a bit, but come on Microsoft, can't you engineer a solution to this known issue? [have, added, has, helped, come, engineer] [weak, right, known]
",spacebar
This IS a problem because you'll be filling out a long form or doing extensive work in a browser and all of a sudden you'll go back a page and lose the data when you barely miss the spacebar and hit one of those keys instead,spacebar
"I've also had users complain about sticking spacebars (yes, even on relatively new keyboards), and they just don't seem to hold up",spacebar
"As others have mentioned here, this keyboard is great with one exception - the spacebar! [have, mentioned, is] [great]
",spacebar
"It is really ironic since the ergonomic form forces your hands to rest at angles, naturally drawing your thumbs away from the center of the spacebar",spacebar
The spacebar as many have mentioned had to be pounded to get it to operate,spacebar
The spacebar works and the keys are softer but by no means too soft,spacebar
"4) I've found that when the computer goes to sleep, I can't wake it up by clicking a button on the wireless mouse or by hitting the spacebar on the wireless keyboard",spacebar
"If you search the internet for the words _Microsoft spacebar fix_, you'll see that this is a common problem (but doesn't always occur--apparently some have this defect, and others don't), and that various people have tried various fixes, but none are really satisfactory",spacebar
"As others have mentioned, this keyboard is excellent in all ways but one - the spacebar",spacebar
"Unfortunately, when your hands are in the natural position your thumbs are at the far left and right of the spacebar",spacebar
I'm not sure how the spacebar made it past quality testing,spacebar
The obvious fix is to improve the design with a split (two piece) spacebar,spacebar
"I'm largely happy with this keyboard but will note several caveats: * The media keys do not provide next/previous track keys * The elevating skirt to raise the front edge of the keyboard is awkward to add/remove and is cheaply constructed * The keys are quite responsive but are a bit louder than I think they need to be, particularly the spacebar Ergonomically this is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used",spacebar
"How is this spacebar possible? [is] [possible]
",spacebar
"The spacebar has two buttons beneath it, but you have to click at just the right point to register a click",spacebar
"The regular keys are not bad, but after 6 weeks with the spacebar, I'm getting rid of it",spacebar
"Also, the ""enter"" key is bit small but even that's okay if only that spacebar acted normally",spacebar
My speed/error rate is horrendous on this keyboard because I can't get the spacebar to properly work and when it does it's so loud,spacebar
"I went ahead and got this in spite of the reviews, hoping I would get a keyboard with a decent spacebar",spacebar
This occurs when you tend to press the spacebar near the top of the spacebar (closer to the next row of letters) vs on the lower half,spacebar
You just wouldn't expect hot spots on keys and the spacebar has hot spots and cold spots,spacebar
"Overall, whatever good thing I had to say about the keyboard, the godforsaken spacebar tosses it out the window",spacebar
"unfortunately, i'm going to return it to the store primarily because the keys are just too hard to push -- especially the spacebar",spacebar
What I'm trying to say is that when you press the spacebar with your left thumb the space bar behaved normally and felt/sounded consistent with any other key,spacebar
"I pulled the spacebar key off a few times and tried to fix it, so far to no avail",spacebar
It's a great keyboard EXCEPT for the spacebar,spacebar
The spacebar keypad measures five and one-half inches in length but is only most responsive at its center,spacebar
Due to a pitifully bad design the spacebar will bend incredibly far before suddenly snapping and finally registering the keypress,spacebar
Keyboard response is stiff/sluggish - especially the spacebar,spacebar
"I went to the local office stores and tried their floor models of the Microsoft 4000, and they all had that thumping sound - only the spacebar",spacebar
My primary desktop keyboard's spacebar ended up choking with a deadline approaching the next day so I had to resort to using this mini keyboard as my primary,spacebar
"However, the split nature of this keyboard makes the space bar longer than those found on traditional keyboards (the MS spacebar is a full 1",spacebar
"With a spacebar actuator on both the left and right sides of the keyboard, this problem would disappear and the space bar would actuate like all of the other keys (which respond nicely)",spacebar
"At this point, when the spacebar is hit at the upper left or right corner, it will jam",spacebar
"If Microsoft had split the spacebar or found a way to make it less clunky and horrible, I probably would have kept the keyboard",spacebar
#NAME?,spacebar
I usually hit the spacebar key with my right hand,spacebar
"Ergo: The shape of the keyboard and placement of keys (other than spacebar), is pretty darn comfortable Keyboard noise/response: Doesn't make too much noise which is good(but neither does it feel rock solid",spacebar
This keyboard seems to drop keystrokes (particularly the spacebar) and there is no known workaround,spacebar
"Aside from a slightly different keyboard layout which I'll have to get used to, I'm much happier with that keyboard -- no problems with the spacebar, very responsive keyboard, and no stiff keys aside from the function keys",spacebar
The spacebar key is springloaded in the middle and if you hit the key on the ends it is a little hard to press down,spacebar
"Edit: ----- I have this keyboard at office now, the spacebar is working much better on that (it could be better though)",spacebar

I was looking for a keyboard with backlighted keys,keys
"I received it and it is NOT visible in poor lighting, despite the claim of the big white lettered keys! [received, is, lettered] [visible, poor, big, white]

"The keys work smoothly and have some hot keys, however I will never use some of them on the Mac so I cannot comment on the keyboard's full potential",keys
"Was really excited about having a compact keyboard with backlit keys for my home media center, but the range proved to be a problem",keys
It has been widely reported and I will confirm: The N key is wider than the other keys (to fill in space) and the mechanical trigger for the key is in the center rather than towards the right where you typically hit the key,keys
"The media keys at the top are nice, and you can customize them a fair bit when you install the Intellikey software",keys
"MS keyboards (especially this one) are very wide and use a ton of space to the right of the arrow keys, mainly for the number pad",keys
The keys feel nice and are pretty quiet,keys
"I like that you can create your own shortcuts for each of the top function keys, and the zoom and back/forward buttons are nice to have (though the back/forward buttons are too far down and my mouse already has those)",keys
The page up and down keys use to be by themselves and now have an insert key right next to them which is annoying,keys
You need really big hands and really long fingers to be able to reach all the number keys,keys
"Well, to my surprise, it does take an unexpectedly strong stroke to get a space compared to the other keys",keys
"I was typing on a phone call and I realized that it was literally difficult to hear my colleague over the ""din"" of my keystrokes",keys
"As a programmer, I can't stand that they changed the layout of the center row (ins, del, pgup, pgdn), slowing me down considerably, as well as the arrow keys (too small &amp; awkward)",keys
"Pros: - perfect ergonomics - nice leather wrist padding Cons: - noisy spacebar - spacebar presses harder then letter keys - F-keys devided into two groups, while classically it should be three - a bit large Could be perfect without issue with spacebar",keys
This was so they could squeeze in the up/down/left/right arrow keys into the layout they wanted,keys
"Will someone inform this keyboard manufacturer that directional keys are very rarely used, but the shift key is used QUITE OFTEN",keys
"The noise was exacerbated by the fact that the other keys are remarkably quiet, so the sound becomes even more annoying",keys
"And worst, the layout of the other keys outside of the main qwerty area of the keyboard, specifically the cursor key, is just a terrible layout for anyone who has used a keyboard regularly at any time in the past 40 years",keys
"As stated in many of the other reviews, the displacement of the arrow keys and the 6 navigation keys is VERY unnerving",keys
It has all the necessary short cut keys and was easy to set up,keys
Full-size keys are easy to press,keys
The keys are responsive and types just fine,keys
I have average sized hands and I always felt like I had to stretch to reach the number and function keys,keys
It was a really stupid feature to overload the function keys with yet another key,keys
"Misses too many keystrokes, and the buttons are laid out in a perfect smashed grid, so you won't be able to type as fast",keys
"Has some but not all ""F"" keys and a dedicated Ctrl+Alt+Del key Cons: Placement of the touchpad is OK but seems to hinder your typing some, Touchpad not very responsive with sensitivity all the way up",keys
"Certain keys (2, 4, T and some others) simply don't work any more",keys
Fortunately I prefer to use the arrow keys and enter inside Boxee so really it ends up being a non-issue,keys
I do not know if this is a function of whatever they are using to put white print on black keys or just cheap junk manufacturing,keys
It's disappointing that something so simple could limit the usable life of a keyboard (without buying some stickers to put on top of the naked keys,keys
The F-keys are convex and even stiffer,keys
"The volume controls and extra function keys are nice, but I wish it wasn't so big and bulky",keys
"First, the good: keypress sounds are quiet, the weird key shapes did a very good job of making it easier for my hands to each the keys on each side, and installation was flawless (I didn't even have to install the software)",keys
The same thing holds for several other keys,keys
It will then relay anywhere from none to all of the keystrokes in rapid succession to the computer (resulting in it spazzing out for a few seconds as it does the things you told it to,keys
"And if you like your keys to have a little bounce to them, you will likely be disappointed by this keyboard as well",keys
The programmable keys are a nice feature,keys
#NAME?,keys
"- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers) Now, THE BAD: - For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT keys are too small!

"I could do with regular sized ""H"" and ""N"" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER",keys
"<p>But, if you are a touch-typist and your fingers already know where the keys are supposed to be, then you'll be greatly disappointed and/or frustrated with this Natural Keyboard Elite",keys
"I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller squished-together arrow keys",keys
"The only great thing this board has going for it is the slight curve of the keys, though it is hardly noticeable, unlike the split ergonomic boards",keys
"All (home, arrows, etc) keys are in a very standard layout for a full-size keyboard",keys
"It was almost a better keyboard than all the rest, BUT - It is less bent than the earlier natural keyboards - - - unless you are tiny, your wrists won't be straight - the home-end-pgup-pgdn key group are changed again - - - back to 2 rows of 3 keys - - - if you just relearned the 3 rows of 2 keys layout, this is really bad - the left corner of the wrist rest is cut way too close - - - if you have big hands the edge digs into your hand - miserable! [was, is, are, be, are, changed, relearned, is, left, is, cut, have, digs] [better, bent, earlier, natural, tiny, straight, key, bad, close, big, miserable]
",keys
"There are lots of bells and whistles such as programmable keys and the sort, but these are more of a gimmick than anything else",keys
"The key response and placement are ok, but it's easy to mistype because of the angle of the keys",keys
The keys were very quiet and smooth,keys
It had many convenient shortcut keys which I could reprogram for my own custom purpose,keys
The reason for this appears to be that there is not one solid plastic piece under the keys,keys
"If you remove some keys, you can see the contacts inside, so if you get a little bit of water on it, it will drip straight down and ruin the entire thing",keys
Someone suggested removing all the keys and spraying some rubbing alcohol down there to help any excess water evaporate out,keys
"Second, it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room, they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key!

The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch,keys
"I had an older version of this keyboard, and the keys on the old keyboard are closer together, or for some reason, just easier to depress",keys
"it's a pity, they didn't take a lesson on how to make keys from the old IBM keyboards from early 1980's",keys
Buy an ergonomic keyboard with standard-sized and configured arrow keys,keys
"MS did some things right: It's in black (gone are the days of the beige box), power user keys a re included, the keyboard now has a base tilt, and finally rest pad",keys
"The right windows key (between the ""alt"" and ""menu"" hot-keys in line with the space bar) is now gone",keys
The function keys now have presets (optional) 4,keys
"There are now silver hot keys at the top for 5 programmable functions and several other keys for standard windows functions such as e-mail, home directory, zoom, mute, increase/decrease volume, play/pause, and calculator 5",keys
"The keys had just the right feel, and the quality was excellent",keys
"If you look closely at the arrow keys, ""Insert"", ""Home"", ""Delete"", and ""End"" keys you will see that the keys are smaller and arranged differently than a standard keyboard",keys
The numeric key pad and the regular typewriter keys are fine,keys
That keyboard's been through hell and is really showing its age in the form of lots of friction and loud keys,keys
The keys are reasonably quiet,keys
"I felt like it needed more tilt and angle to the keys, but otherwise was a reasonable keyboard",keys
I do wish they had kept the editing keys and dispensed with the num pad altogether so that the keyboard wouldn't take up so much desk space,keys
"I simply could not find the break, but there definitely was one in the flex circuit because all the other keys worked",keys
"pros: Decent product, works, has plenty of hot keys",keys
I have both the old kind (arrow keys in an inverted-T shape) and a new kind (arrow keys in a cross pattern) This keyboard had inherent problems with Windows NT 4,keys
I like keys that have a consistent feedback,keys
"A keyboard has its first use: be good and efficient in hitting those keys - all the other stuff is secondary! [has, be, hitting, is] [first, good, efficient, other, secondary]
",keys
"Partly because I was trained on IBM selectrics and manual typewriters that belonged to my grandparents, and partly because I'm a classically trained cellist, my fingers slam into those keys fast and hard",keys
Since the ergonomic keyboards are shaped in a wave form (of sorts) there is a nominal communication from the keys that one has indeed typed that letter,keys
Number one annoyance:  The Caps Lock key is placed so closely to the Tab and Shift keys that I am forever grumbling at this machine as I accidentally hit the Caps Lock key instead of Shift or Tab,keys
"When you first get this keyboard (especially new builds, 2011) their keys are soft and quiet and it's the best keyboard there is",keys
"Some terrible things about the product (when compared to the Chinese iPazzPort, which is likely a knockoff of the Rii that has other features added): * The mouse is not multi-touch * There are no page-up/page-down keys that can be accessed without also holding down the ""function"" key (compared to the iPazzPort which has a page up/down rocker on the side of the device next to the laser pointer switch) * The laser pointer is very weak compared to the iPazzPort * The laser pointer requires the radio to be turned on * The F-keys are the default; you have to use the function+Fkey combination to access things like volume up/down",keys
"Because the F keys can be activated without a key combination, they can be combined with modifiers (like ALT) which makes application hot keys (e",keys
"Finally, there are nubs on the F and J keys to allow for finding the home row in the dark (although the blue backlighting (compare to orange with the iPazzPort) is easy to activate)",keys
I was also happy to find that Windows multimedia keys were included on the keyboard,keys
"I am an average-sized woman at 5'5"", and have relatively long fingers, but the reach on this keyboard from the home keys to the Q/Tab or backspace/enter was absurdly and uncomfortably far",keys
"Although all of the keys worked on the second keyboard, they still felt really stiff (especially the space bar), making for a very unpleasant typing experience",keys
"Extra F keys (Fn+1=F9, Fn+2=F10, Fn+3=F11, and Fn+4=F12) 3) Sometimes capslock get reversed I'm not sure why it happens but to go back to normal with caps on switch keyboard off the back on",keys
All the other keys were soft and easy to type,keys
"It just doesn't have the extra keys like calculator, volume control, etc",keys
"Elite also has smaller keys for the arrow keys, the page up/down, home/end, and delete/insert keys",keys
"Much as I like the subtly curved design and the widening keys, the power shortcut keys, they're of no use to me when it repetedly breaks down",keys
"The mechanisms don't seem to be built for larger keys, so you have to find sweet spots in keys like CTRL and the space bar, or else you're just bending plastic without registering a keystroke",keys
"On OS X, IntelliType is required if you want to swap the CTRL, ALT, and Windows keys to represent CTRL, Option, and Command keys on a standard Mac keyboard",keys
"other than that, just hate that microsoft messed up on the keycodes for the zoom keys",keys
It will lock-up and have my character running in some random direction no matter which keys I hit after that,keys
Extra keys above number pad are useful and make sense,keys
HOME END BLOCK and Arrow keys maintain their usual shape which is good,keys
'Back' and 'Forward' keys not real keyboard keys and they stick,keys
"The 'back' and 'forward' should be replace with real keys that can be programmed to something useful to the user like backspace, enter, cntl, cmd or windows key",keys
This would hopefully reduce the need to constantly use ones little fingers to hit these important keys with out freaking of users that want to maintain as much normalcy as possible,keys
"I like the special keys for Zoom, Back, Forward, Calculator, - () backspace",keys
When typing the main keys you are fine and this definitely has a much more ergonomic feel than other keyboards I have tested over the years,keys
As for the non-ergonomic aspect of the keyboard there are plenty of keys along the top of the keyboard that can be programmed to limit the amount of times one has to use a mouse,keys
The keys have a good feel,keys
"Also,  the space bar requires much more push than the rest of the keys",keys
"Pros: - nice compact size for thumb typing on the couch - good battery life and recharge-ability via USB - up/down left/right keys nice for navigating WMC and XBMC - back-lit keys for dark rooms Cons: - not durable at all (don't let it fall) - laser pointer feature useless for my application of this product (might be okay for PowerPoint slide viewing on a projector screen) - very limited RF receiver to keyboard range - has to have very unobstructed line of sight or typing/mousing functionality will be severely impacted - very bad placement of left/right mouse click buttons (after using this product I can say the ideal place for these would be in the upper left-hand corner ; thank you for this lesson FAVI as I will keep it in mind while I'm searching for your product's replacement) This was my first attempt at the ultimate HTPC keyboard/mouse, and after using it, I can say this product was good at pointing out all the flaws of these types of devices in today's market",keys
It is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used because of the curved layout and the super soft keys,keys
"I ultimately chose it for ergonomics, and it's insert/home/delete/end configuration, which was very important to me, because I use those keys constantly too",keys
"The first is that sometimes it will lose signal for 5-10 second, after which time all the keystrokes you make may or may not appear at once",keys
"really, i found most of the hot keys MS decided to put on the keyboard not very usefull: mail, search, home, calculator and then 5 custom keys",keys
"it has media keys that do work with the mac; but it's missing a very important ""next track"" and somewhat less important ""prev track""",keys
"the keys on the apple keyboard are very nice: short action, soft touch, tactile feedback",keys
"of course, the predefined hotkeys on the apple keyboard suit my mac better: expose, dashboard, and a full set of itunes controls",keys
"It's a great, lightweight, quiet design and has just the right amount of ""extra"" keys",keys
So maybe I guess I just bought a faulty one; surely Microsoft does not make and entire model of keyboard where the keys malfunction after only a few months,keys
"All keys (including left and right click under the touchpad), backlight, and laser pointer still work",keys
I have Dell keyboards that after 10 years the labels on the keys are just fine,keys
"The keys have a nice tactile feel; nothing outstanding, but it feels better than many keyboards I have used",keys
"Even then, even if you mashed some keys on your keyboard at the same time you woke up your mouse, they keyboard will take longer",keys
The spacebar works and the keys are softer but by no means too soft,keys
"Thing is, it's a windows keyboard so even though it uses a USB, none of the internet keys work with the imac, with the exception of the volume control, and that's disappointing",keys
The keys are in decent places,keys
"For one, people say the keys are quite easy to press, it is, slightly",keys
The wireless optical pro kit that has a ergo keybord like this is much softer meaning all you have to do is slightly tap the keys and you're good to go,keys
"It's compact, has a full keyboard with a logical layout of keys, has an effective touchpad with a scrolling zone on the right side, and has great backlighting and battery life",keys
On rare occasions this happens with other keys as well,keys
"If you set the keyboard down flat, most keyboards the keys will sit pretty close to flat from the row with the numbers on it to the row with the space bar on it",keys
"I just use it to do my work and paper typing, but the unacceptable thing is that several keys' ""life expectancy"" is too short",keys
"It's completely unusable in games: Nothing brings you out of gaming annoys you quite like your keyboard simply stopping working for 5-10 seconds at a time, and THEN sending all those keystrokes at once",keys
I am using this keyboard on the mac - i was able to program the keys all ok - took some doing,keys
"The touch of the keys is soft and comfy, the ergonomic design is brilliant and requires little adjustment, but the space bar  sticks and clacks",keys
The keys are easy to use,keys
So if you're thinking that you text fast & this wouldn't be a problem consider the inch of dead space between your thumb & the keys,keys
These may seem like minor quibbles to some of you -- but they preclude the possibility of hitting these keys without looking at them,keys
"This does not have a full sized keyboard, and while I thought I might be able to live with it anyway, my hands are too large and I'm too used to a full sized keyboard to get my fingers to hit the correct keys, even when concentrating",keys
"The right shift key, in particular, is a real problem because Logitech replaces the full sized key with two smaller keys: Shift and Enter",keys
"Pros: Installs easily, Small size, good battery life, keys work well",keys
"The slight curve design has alleviated a great deal of pain on my wrists and the shortcut keys are great for fast access to the email, web, etc",keys
"The curve and the size of some of the keys, however, make it not optimal for the small-handed, such as myself",keys
Alt-f4 doesn't work because Microsoft remapped the keys on this keyboard so the keyboard's shortcuts don't work the same way as the Windows operating system,keys
On almost every occasion I would have to hit one of my password characters twice and at same time double check the screen so I didn't miss type or type extra keys,keys
"Still, it was VERY difficult to reach the upper keys, even after I got used to the split keyboard",keys
"I use some of the extra keys, for example, I use the sound volume and muting functions frequently, as well as the calculator button",keys
"Because I use a 4-key trackball, I have no use for the browsing keys",keys
"Also, there is no way of having indication of when caps/scroll lock/numlock keys are on/off, which is stupid because my very old S510 told me on-screen through the SetPoint software- which **should** work with this combo also, but it doesn't",keys
"So if you get this then forget having any extra adjustments or on-screen displays for volume, lock keys, etc",keys
"I will say neither the kbd or mouse ever missed a keystroke or click, but most any keyboard can do that",keys
"I was glad for the function keys, since this is replacing one of those wired Dell multimedia keyboards with the round volume control knobs (which I really liked)",keys
The keys themsleves have a great tactile feel and are very quiet - exaclty what I was looking for,keys
"Any time I would press certain keys (E, C, X, Enter, Delete), the thing would go haywire and press all kinds of random characters and cause general chaos in both my Windows XP and Mac OS X machines",keys
It always happened when I would press a key (such as the arrow keys) in rapid succession,keys
"I'm largely happy with this keyboard but will note several caveats: * The media keys do not provide next/previous track keys * The elevating skirt to raise the front edge of the keyboard is awkward to add/remove and is cheaply constructed * The keys are quite responsive but are a bit louder than I think they need to be, particularly the spacebar Ergonomically this is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used",keys
My previous keyboard had a solid feel and the keys were very responsive,keys
"I bought a 4000 in December,and now, less than eight months later, I can't see five letter keys or the period, and some of the other letters are shrinking as parts of them disappear",keys
In this case the arrow keys are not in their normal positions,keys
"It's a comfortable keyboard to use, and the extras like the volume buttons and other shortcut keys are nice, but the workmanship and quality is just lousy",keys
"The arrangement of the Home/Page Up/Page Dn/End/Delete/Insert and arrow keys may allow the keyboard to fit in trays, but otherwise it is insane",keys
I never realized how much I use those keys until I was swearing at this keyboard,keys

"The design is nice, small, compact, full keyboard, the keys aren't too small, and it lights up for use in dark spaces",keys
"Unfortunately, the keys on this model, particularly the space key, are too stiff",keys
I had seen complaints about the stiff keys in other reviews but was hoping this was not a universal problem,keys
But the keyboard itself has a cheap feel to it (much cheaper than the Dell keyboard I was using) and the keys are a bit mushy,keys

"Pros: * Backlit keys * Mouse pad that works in both orientations * rechargable * very small and portable * useless laser pointer (maybe a con also as the kids might shoot each other in the face with it) * fairly cheap Cons: - limited range, like 10 feet at best - mine wont connect using the extension cable, must plug directly into machine",keys
"I attributed this to the unusual wave design of the key layout which is supposed to promote stress free typing, which is does -- but while promoting a bad style of typing preventing the keyboard user from typing all other keys!

"The keys on this keyboard don't ""snap back"" like some of the better keyboards do when you press them down",keys
"In general this is a good keyboard: * comfortable wrist pads * excellent ergonomic positioning of the keys * plug and play in windows 7 - I did not install the software that came with keyboard and all the keys I ever use work without it (including volume up/down, play/pause etc",keys
"From the pictures it looks like the same, poor placement of the ""6"" key that Microsoft continues in all of their ""ergonomic"" keyboards that have a small separation between the left and right handed keys",keys
The overall keyboard feels smooth and the keys are easier to use than a square keyboard,keys
"Other keys on the Microsoft ""product"" also gummy now",keys
Features are great including new keys introduced above keypad and soft handrest,keys
You just wouldn't expect hot spots on keys and the spacebar has hot spots and cold spots,keys
As with nearly al other home theater keyboards I which it had a backlight so I can see the keys in a dark home theater setting,keys
"The keys have a decent feel, although I prefer either the old IBM click keys or even Apple's keyboards, which are softer but still offer tactile feedback",keys
"I have enjoyed the specialty keys, though, particularly the mute/volume keys",keys
"Lots of the custom keys go unused, though, because the software to assign them isn't all that flexible",keys
I'm a Natural Keyboard fan and like the placement of the keys,keys
"Typing is no problem, but the smaller sized Function and arrow keys make it difficult to quickly execute a command or navigate around the page",keys
I prefer the keys on original MS Natural Keyboard,keys
"The only aspect that is really, really annoying is the arrangement of the 4 arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN)-- the separate arrow keys that are not embedded in the number pad",keys
"Since the keys(especially spacebar) are pretty tight even compared to regular non-ergo keyboards, it increased the intensity and frequency of the pain I experienced earlier",keys
"I work with numbers so the four keys that are above the numeric keyboard are very useful for me, as well as the calculator button",keys
"A built in lithium-ion battery is rechargeable through a USB cable;  back lit, the keys are clearly visible at night or in a darkened room",keys
"The keys, while of adequate size and nicely convexly shaped, require quite a bit of pressure to register a key stroke causing a necessary carefulness, slowing input considerably",keys
"However, these soft keys aren't bad, just not as good as the springy ones",keys
"The rest of the keyboard is fine, and the formerly afflicted keys function correctly when another keyboard is plugged in",keys
"What's worse, some, but possibly not all, of your keystrokes may get buffered and sent later, which can be extremely frustrating for gamers and the like",keys
"I've found that the ""silk screening"" on many of the keys wears off - A, S, D, F, E for example",keys
"I'm a big fan of the 'extra' keys across the top, and got used to the media keys on my Kensington keyboard (FF/R)",keys
"However, like many others have noted, the key layout of the arrow keys, the 6 keys above them, and the function keys (F1 - F12) are not the standard size/shape",keys
"I use them so much the keys develop a shiny, smooth surface (in other words, the slightly nubby texture gets worn off)",keys
"Without drivers, the only way I use keyboards- and mice, all the grey feature keys function as expected except those numbered one through five and the star key below that group",keys
"Sure I could have used S-Spline graphics software to enhance the relatively tine fully sized image, but I expect a full sized, especially natural keyboard, to sport TWO Windows Flag keys",keys
"If that is not an issue, and you require neither key tap resistance, nor key tap click feedback then you will be happy with this natural keyboard -- the additional 'curve' of the keys offered no challenge to me already familiar with microsoft natural keyboards,  I appreciate the 'front loaded' height of the keyboard, but the padding leaves much to be desired",keys
"There is also a series of special function keys that allow you to access mail, calculator, web browser home page, etc",keys
Then there's the distractingly inconsistent touch and sound of the Comfort Curve's keys,keys
"Worse still, the paint has rubbed off many of the keys",keys
"The arrow keys are not in the same layout as the standard keyboard, and the 6 keys above them 3x2 instead of 2x3",keys
"I'd use a newer model of it, but they also ruined the layout when they added the shift feature to the function keys",keys
"Would have been fine if the default was for the function keys, but no, they made it for the others, which have always been shortcuts on your keyboard anyway",keys
"If your a touch typist and use all your fingers and don't look at the keys it's fine once you get used to the hump in the middle of the key board, but I can type faster with two or three fingers than I can with nine",keys
"Keyboard has a nice feel to it, nice feedback from the keys",keys
"Undaunted, I tried another, the second board was slightly better in that all the keys seemed to work",keys
The keys - especially the space bar - require far more force to use that my previous keyboard,keys
"Of course, the split keys are OK",keys
"It is also quite low profile which would be alright except that there is only about an inch of plastic to try to rest your hands on below the bottom row of keys, which means that your hands are sitting on the desk as you try to type",keys
"The arrow keys are much more difficult to use than the standard, well-designed inverted T layout",keys
"While your fingers rested comfortably on the bottom row of arrow keys in the old layout, in the new your fingers don't really fit at all--you can only put two fingers on at once, and you need to move them in awkward ways to switch to the up and down keys from the left and right keys",keys
"Why move the keys around into a LESS useful layout? [move] [useful]
",keys
"If you're like me and you end up typing on lots of different keyboards, AND you use the arrow keys a lot to navigate, it turns out to be quite painful to switch back and forth between the different layouts",keys
"Media control keys should be switched with Function Keys, I'm sure people will be using the play/pause button more often than F7",keys
"Range is good, about what is advertized, but I have found that if there is something/someone between keyboard and receiver than its about 50% on keystroke accuracy",keys
With a clear line of sight I would but keystroke accuracy at about 90% Final Thoughts: I am very happy with the price/product,keys
The right shift key seemed to have been made poorly b/c it was much louder and had a different pitch than the other keys,keys
"I have owned this keyboard for 4 days now, I loved it at first, lightweight comfortable to use, the keys aren't loud when you're typing and then tonight I began having problems",keys
"Everything about it is good in principle:  the keys are big enough to easily press, light up nicely in the dark, and are still small enough to fit in something the size of a normal remote",keys
"The main thing I've been looking for in a new ergonomic keyboard is the correct setup for the arrow keys, with left, down, and right in a straight row, and up right above down (follow that? ['ve, been, looking, is, left, follow] [main, new, ergonomic, correct, straight]
",keys
All the keys have a fairly consistent feel and are quiet,keys
"I preferred the utility button layout of the older Natural Keyboard Pro, and rather wish the function keys had their normal functions on the top (F1, F2, etc",keys
"If all the keys were this loud, it wouldn't be a problem, but it's very annoying and distracting to be typing and have a very loud slam/click every time I hit a space",keys
"I have a pretty hard keystroke, so I really put it through the wringer",keys
"It has decent keys, etc",keys
I ordered this keyboard for it's small size and backlit keys,keys
"It's comfortable in the hand, the keys give a nice tactile feedback when pressing them, the touchpad works great, the backlight works great",keys
#NAME?,keys
#NAME?,keys
"I could do with regular sized ""H"" and ""N"" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER",keys
#NAME?,keys
It did seem to have some neat features/ short cut keys though - I am really disappointed the rest of it didn't work better,keys
The wider base and outward angle of the keys put me in a more natural typing posture with less strain on my wrists,keys
"Not only does this keyboard put me in a better position with the keys angled out, it also raises the front end of the keyboard, further forcing the user into good typing posture",keys
"Unfortunately I do have issues with the keys in the bottom row of the right group (n, m, comma, period, /) not registering",keys
"However, the one I just received in black had a very loud space bar that was also too loose, especially compared to all of the other keys",keys
Suggest you paint all your keys with clear fingernail polish to protect the painted on letters,keys
It could be any number of keys or any pattern of keys that will go faulty because of poor grounding internally,keys
"After a few months of putting up with this, the keyboard started sending shutdown commands to various applications if you just lift the keyboard or touched any of the keys",keys
This is very frustrating to my wife who has to look at the keys to type,keys
Its because of the section where the mouse pad is puts a distance between your right thumb and the alpha keys,keys
They keys were nice & quiet which was great,keys
I'm not used to nor need the extra special dedicated buttons/keys,keys
"By then I was so stressed, I was jealous they didn't have to deal with the curve any longer, but all my keys still worked",keys
The keys are slightly raised so it's easy to type,keys
"second: WHY IS THERE A START next to my shift and ctrl keys? [IS] [second]
",keys
"other than that, they keys feel okay, I miss my keytronic 1985 ergo board I had last century, it was MORE designed for ten finger typists that did 200 pages ON MECHANICAL TYPEWRITERS, a day",keys
sadly it appears all keybds designed after a certain year all have these misfit keys placed in the WORSE POSSIBLE PLACE,keys
Going to dump this and hope to find one with softer keys,keys
"Now if Microsoft could figure out how to combine the light, pleasing keys from that with this one's ergonomic shape, they'd have a real winner",keys
"I suspect it's because instead of the older (and more expensive) method of injection molding the symbols on the keys which makes them a permanent part of the key, they are now using the much cheaper method of using something like decals which is only a surface treatment and so rub off fairly quickly",keys
The keys were clear looking and you had to pull of a back plate of the keyboard to get to the wireless receiver,keys
"Several keys that you will use very often are even harder: The space, backspace and enter key",keys
"A cheaper keyboard, Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 is much better, although its ""Backspace"" is also stupidly harder to press than other keys",keys
"However, be aware that Microsoft decided to rearrange several clusters of keys on this keyboard",keys
"The arrow keys are in a diamond pattern rather than the traditional (and IMHO efficient) ""inverted-T""",keys
"As a touch-typist and a programmer, I've come to expect these keys to be in a certain position",keys
"It may have helped shoulder and wrist pain a bit, but it caused my fingers to hurt terribly from having to hit the keys harder than I liked",keys
"The design is great, keys are easy to push",keys
The keys feel soft and less clicky than my MS Wireless Pro keyboard ($99),keys
"I do appreciate that the numberpad and the function keys (Insert, Delete, Home, etc) are in the traditional arrangement",keys
"For people who have heavy keystrokes, the heavy keys might be okay",keys
"For someone like me who likes light keys with positive action and who likes to type with a ""fluid"" style of motion, this keyboard is far from ideal",keys
"I would recommend this keyboard only for those who do not mind having heavy keys (as a comparison, if you have an IBM laptop and like the firm keys, this keyboard might be for you)",keys
"If you want an ""ergonomic"" keyboard with split and angled key layout, check out the Logitech alternative which feature lighter keys",keys
The extra shortcut keys are pretty awesome,keys
"Now, granted, this keyboard does allow it, but you have to perform a two-keystroke combination",keys
My old keyboard allows me to immediately bring up the correction box with one keystroke,keys
This new unit requires either going to my mouse or performing a cumbersome two-keystroke combination,keys
I have three different wireless Logitech keyboards here and they all have different placements for these keys,keys
"It's very, very annoying to not be able to blindly hit these keys universally",keys
"Well, I would not expect you would have to manually turn on the back lighting (which is not equally lit on all keys) and if you forget, the battery drains quicker",keys
"If you don't use the device for a few minutes, it goes into some sleep state and then have to press a variety of keys to wake up",keys
I have tried several of Microsoft's split keyboards and found that the space bar and some other keys did not operate smoothly on several models so I returned them,keys
"This keyboard is not only less expensive than those, but all the keys operate smoothly and with a small amount of noise",keys
"Besides making those keys smaller than older boards, I see no reason for them to have rearranged them, but I'm sure that in time my hands will get used to it",keys
If you rest your wrist on it such that you bend your hand up to reach the keys you may cause yourself some wrist problems,keys
"So all in all, the keys operate nicely, it's reasonably quiet and seems that it will be around my office for quite some time",keys
The extra features you get with the 4000 (like the zoom controller and soft keys) are marginal at best and don't make up for the lack of reliability,keys
I bought this to help with carpel tunnel but it has made it worse  You have to really push to use the keys and stretch like crazy if you have small hands  i have made 6 mistakes typing this,keys
"Loved that keyboard, but the keys only held up for a little over a year before getting really difficult to use",keys
"It is really responsive( at least 15 feet away, which is all you would want to be) and the keys type just like you would text on a phone",keys
"The main keys are fairly quiet, but the spacebar ""clacks"" like a gun going off in comparison",keys
"The main keys are a bit quieter than my 10+ yr old ""Microsoft Natural Keyboard"" but overall that one is quieter compared to the constant ""clack"" (like there's ducks in my office) of the space bar",keys
"I still prefer my old PS/2 white (now yellow) keyboard w/o all of the ""hot keys"" which is working great still but just no pretty anymore",keys
The keys are very quiet,keys
The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite is easy to type on - the keys feel light and you don't need to use too much pressure,keys
"It does not have separate 'Home', 'End', 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys that I use very frequently",keys
"They keys are arranged in a straight rectangle fashion, not staggered like a regular qwerty keyboard, so it's often unintuitive to type on it",keys
"Unfortunately, for about 1/4 of the keys, when you press keys, the keyboard sends two keystrokes - the key pressed and the neighbouring key",keys
The keys are soft and not overly loud,keys
"I took it apart to see why it stopped working and I was surprised to see that the plastic ""floor"" under the keys is not a single piece, but actually has lots of cracks and holes by design, and they give direct access to the electronics to anything you may throw in there by accident",keys
"Withing six months an even worse problem (letters wearing off on the keys)with this keyboard! [Withing, wearing] [worse]
",keys
"I was seduced by the fancy function keys, the zoom bottom, and the cushioned wrist rest",keys
The rest of the keys were quiet,keys
"Aside from that, the keyboard feels comfortable and it's correctly sized, and provides some extra keys that some might find useful (multimedia, mail, desktop, window switching and so)",keys
"As with several other people who have shared their thoughts on this product, I must say that I absolutely hate it because of the tiny arrow, page up/down, home, insert, delete, and end keys",keys
"As a HTPC remote, this keyboard surely has far too few built-in media keys",keys
"It only has mute, volume up and down keys at the top",keys
"I've been using PowerDVD on the PC for a long time and I'm very much used to just pressing F, B, N, P (hotkeys for forward, rewind, next chapter, previous chapter) instead of using dedicated media keys",keys
"There are also many special functions accessible only via hotkeys, such as Blu-ray's red, blue, green, and yellow buttons",keys
So I'm very comfortable being without dedicated media keys,keys
"It feels more cramped than a laptop keyboard, mainly due to the much smaller Enter, right Shift, Backspace, and Control keys, which are the most used (that's why they are usually made wider)",keys
"Other often-used keys like Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn also need to be Fn-extended (meaning you need to press the green Fn key plus another key)",keys
"I like the soft feel of the keys and it's not terribly noisy, like my Dell L100",keys
"But one attribute kills the potential beauty of this board, the space bar, which is one of the most used keys",keys
"Keyboard feels decent, although I will say that the keys feel like they have multiple-levels and it's kind of odd to hear the space bar make 3-4 clicks for one function (this could just be exclusively my remote) The one MAJOR con I have is the fact that it's an RF device that is easily attenuated by your left hand and seemingly has line-of-sight problems",keys
"The size of this keyboard is built more for guys who have larger hands, and I find I have to constantly move my hand around or stretch my fingers to reach all the letter keys",keys
"Touch typists all know that the first five number keys are hit by the fingers of the left hand, and six through ten are hit by the right",keys
"I just can't get used to the Ergo type keyboard, used to a flat one, never seem to get my fingers on the right keys",keys
Looks like they have one light in the middle and it barely manages to light up the far away keys,keys
I would have much preferred the arrow keys placed under the touch pad buttons than in its current location,keys
unfortunately the small right shift key and its promximity to the arrow keys produces way too many errors for touch typists,keys
"To make matters worse the reduced-size cursor keys are not in the usual inverted T, but in a cruciform arrangement, which makes this keyboard pretty useless for people who engage in FPS games like Quake 2/3, Unreal etc",keys
"First, which is more minor: the F-keys (F1-F12) are super small, yet there is a TON of dead space on the keyboard that could have easily accommodated normal sized F-keys or additional media buttons (more on this later)",keys
"Second: there is little difference between the height and feeling of the ""mouse"" keys for left and right clicks and the height of the touchpad",keys
"For example, most keyboards have small nubs or bevels on the ""F"" and ""J"" keys that make it easier to know where your fingers are on the keyboard without looking down",keys
This keyboard also doesn't have media keys other than for volume and mute,keys
"Many keyboards, including most others from Logitech, have keys for playing music and video for functions like Previous, Next, Play, Stop, etc",keys
"Even if the keyboard required something like Logitech's SetPoint software installed in order to use keys like this, that would be fine",keys
I often find myself fat fingering keys,keys
What's bad about it (minor points):  - It's hard to pick up the keyboard without hitting one of those goofy programmable side keys  - I don't like those extra programmable keys,keys
"----------------------------------------------------------------------- EDIT: 7/2012 The shift and spacebar keys have developed too much resistance, and it's worsening my already sore tendons",keys
"half the keys during the first year, making it very difficult to tell which is which",keys
"I tested the keyboard on several computers and stripped the keys off and replaced them with those of the first keyboard, just in case there was another problem with the keys",keys
So  i purchased this product it works great with the keys and everything it just the touchpad it randomly wouldnt respond it was extremely irritating and i would recommend you look around for different wireless keyboards,keys
The second started sending random keystrokes to the computer after about a month,keys
The key layout uses smaller keys than usual and takes a while to get used to,keys
Those keys are incredibly easy to press and the back of the keyboard rises slightly so you don't have to reach as far for the top rows,keys
These keyboards are destroyed the moment a few drops of liquid gets in-between the keys,keys
"However, just as the previous versions of the Natural, if you plan on using many keys simultaneously, this is not your keyboard",keys
"The Natural 4000 shines in that it is very comfortable as the wrist rest area has built in pads with a soft leatherette feel, the keys are quiet, and we see a return to the front riser which alleviates wrist strain due to it assisting in keeping your wrists straight",keys
"The Natural also gets high marks in that the keys are quiet, they are arranged in the correct standard of 104 or so key layout, so if you are a developer, you know exactly where the keys are going to be (as far as special symbols, namely the ""|"" key, the arrow keys, and the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", etc) are in their correct locations",keys
"This keyboard comes with many media keys that allow you to do such things as start your music player, adjust your volume, start many popular programs including your web browser, etc",keys
"With the leatherette in the front, the soft glowing leds, and the extra meta keys, it reminds someone as if he or she has upgraded his or her keyboard to a sports car",keys
"While many people could argue that they do not use the function keys, in an office environment one most certainly does (how many times do you hit F3 to ""look for the search result again"" after searching for text in a text editor? [argue, do, use, does, do, hit, look, searching] [many, many]
",keys
The biggest issue I have is the number of keys one can press at a time before the keyboard simply can't handle any more input,keys
"First person shooters, one may be able to pull it off, but even the simplest games such as Continuum, or even old titles such as Interstate 76 where multiple keys will be pressed as you are holding one key down for movement, and another one for an action, it is probably headed for failure",keys
"The only final notes I can add for the Natural is noting the additional media keys, your mileage of going through a KVM to control multiple computers will vary",keys
"Also, the Natural 4000 works well with Linux (but again, not well from the Gaming perspective) as there are a few methods that can be used to allow use of the additional media keys",keys
"I thought that i would miss keys because it has been years since my last microsoft natural keyboard, but i have a surprisingly low error rate - the shape is about the same as my old one I would guess",keys
LIKES: * TACTILE: I really like the tactile resistance of these keys when typing,keys
"Nothing irks me more than a loose-buttoned keyboard where the buttons shake and click, and this keyboard is the diametrical opposite of that - a nice firm keystrike, with good push-back",keys
Most of the short cut keys even function with my locked down computer at work,keys
It's sooo easy to get spoiled on the convenient layout of the keys,keys
"My main and only gripe with the Dinovo was missing F1-F12 keys, and having to Fn+click for right-mouse click",keys
I would have given it only one star but liked the other functionality of the keys and especially the raised lip on the bottom of the wrist side of the keyboard,keys
"(negative angle is when the edge of the keyboard where the space bar is,is higher than the further edge of the keyboard, where the function keys are)",keys
"Like so many others, a bunch of keys stopped working on mine",keys
"With a spacebar actuator on both the left and right sides of the keyboard, this problem would disappear and the space bar would actuate like all of the other keys (which respond nicely)",keys
All but one of the keys on this keyboard are great,keys
the constant fishing around for the proper keystrokes led only by your sense of touch,keys
The media controls: Are only accessible via function keys,keys
Could have more WMC keys,keys
My last keyboard lasted me about five years and all of the keys are still readable,keys
There's a nice feel to the hand placement and good action in the keys,keys
"I do transcription work, I haven't been able to become fully adjusted to the arrangement of the keys",keys
"The biggest pains are the number 6 key, and the distance between the arrow keys and the alpha keypad",keys
"My second objection is that the I don't feel the raised bumps on the F, J, and 5 keys , and I frequently find my fingers in the wrong position, typing junk, and having to go back and correct",keys
"I really didn't need to, my fingers fly on the old KB, but wanted USB and wanted a bit quieter keys",keys
"), and the split in the keys is very comfortable for me",keys
"Now I don't need a specific ""gaming KB"" to play games, but I do need to be able to press more than 2 or 3 keys simultaneously",keys
"* On my PS2 old KB, the backslash is under the ENTER key, and I use that key for game functions (I game with mouse and arrow keys, not with WASD keys)",keys
"It is a decent KB, comfortable, split very well, and quiet keys",keys
"Ergo: The shape of the keyboard and placement of keys (other than spacebar), is pretty darn comfortable Keyboard noise/response: Doesn't make too much noise which is good(but neither does it feel rock solid",keys
"Billions of useful hotkeys: You don't need all of them, but there are plenty of options, and if you start to get lazy there's a key for everything or a key you can customize to get anything done",keys
I can't tell you how many keys I have assigned that require me to hit something with the side of my hand or pinky finger,keys
"With inlaid keys, this becomes difficult to impossible",keys
"The second problem is that this comes with a key stroke limit - after you have about 3 keys down at once, it stops reading what you are doing",keys
"Aside from a slightly different keyboard layout which I'll have to get used to, I'm much happier with that keyboard -- no problems with the spacebar, very responsive keyboard, and no stiff keys aside from the function keys",keys
"It was hard for me to reach all the keys that required my pinkies (it actually hurt and gave me finger cramps! [was, reach, required, hurt, gave] [hard]
",keys
the keys are soft to the touch and i didn't mind that either,keys
This probably would have been fine if it wasn't for the addition of arrow keys wedged in under the Enter key,keys
"It does have a nice feeling keystroke, the range and accuracy of the wireless seems excellent, and the touchpad (the reason I bought this model vs",keys
However the keys themselves are labeled with what appears to be just wet-transfer decals (like the ones you get in a model airplane kit) which will undoubtedly rub off with use,keys
"its easy on your hands from a position point, but I wonder how much wear and tear I am getting from the way I have to pound these keys? [wonder, tear, am, getting, have, pound] [easy, much]

I have also worn most of the letters off the keys,keys
"I really liked this keyboard when I got it, despite the fact that it was missing the 'V' key and had two 'D' keys instead",keys
The keys have a sure over-center action,keys
"I enjoy the ergonomics of the key board, but one feature that I also love is the quite touch keys",keys
Don't be gutless like me and make sure you return your keyboard if any of hte keys make clicking noises,keys
The slightest drop of liquid on the keys of this keyboard will completely ruin it,keys

I'm using this for a HTPC and it has good range but is awkward to use in dim light,range
"Tested this out at my office, and it works great as a presentation tool, but with the shoddy reception (at any range or without line-of-sight), it simply doesn't cut it as a replacement keyboard",range

"I was a bit wary about this keyboard after reading all of the negative comments regarding its range here, but I never even got to a point where I could test the range for myself",range
"Strangely, my offense is nearly good enough to be my defense while the keyboard is frozen",range
"Pros ++ Keyboard installs itself on Vista or later and all extra keys work with the basic drivers ++ Key layout is curved slightly, good for those who don't want a full split keyboard ++ Integrated number pad is a nice extra for a budget keyboard ++ Quiet key action will suit those who don't like loud ""clicky"" keyboards ++ CTRL Shortcuts are starred under common keys like x, c, v, b, u, I, & f, making this a good learning keyboard ++ Additional extra keys include the normal function keys, back, forward, music controls and 3 extras (web/home, search & mail) ++ There's even a calculator shortcut button built-in ++ Keyboard's lower profile is much thinner than most ergonomic keyboards ++ Lowest cost in an ergonomic keyboard makes this an option for those on a budget Cons -- Plastic body is noticeably cheap -- Keys have little tactile feedback, making this unpleasant to use for longer periods -- Not curved enough for those who prefer full split ergonomic designs -- Keys are sticker prints that will eventually wear off (typical of low cost keyboards) -- High failure rates (also typical of low cost keyboards ALTERNATIVES It's a challenge to find decent results with ergonomic or split keyboards in this price range",range
"I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller squished-together arrow keys",range
The newly sized and arranged directional arrows are impossible to correctly hit without first hitting every other key around them,range

"Finally, there are nubs on the F and J keys to allow for finding the home row in the dark (although the blue backlighting (compare to orange with the iPazzPort) is easy to activate)",range
I realize and expected a low quality device given that peripherals of this price range are dominated by cheap Chinese products however I must warn any potential customer that this device is far below even most cheap Chinese knock-off devices you will find on the internet and that's really saying something,range
Not because its a good device or because it has redeeming qualities but merely because there is no device in this price range that can replace this one's functions,range
I'm not sure if I got a defective model (seems to be a lot of those) but at the range from which it worked I could practically just use the keyboard on my laptop instead,range
"The computer is right behind the TV, so I've got to stand right next to TV to be able to received to be in range",range
They gave me some strange looks because they had to order a special one for me,range
Microsoft is such a strange company,range
"After only a few days of use, the spacebar stopped working, and the number keys were either broken or typing strange combinations",range
"Pros: - nice compact size for thumb typing on the couch - good battery life and recharge-ability via USB - up/down left/right keys nice for navigating WMC and XBMC - back-lit keys for dark rooms Cons: - not durable at all (don't let it fall) - laser pointer feature useless for my application of this product (might be okay for PowerPoint slide viewing on a projector screen) - very limited RF receiver to keyboard range - has to have very unobstructed line of sight or typing/mousing functionality will be severely impacted - very bad placement of left/right mouse click buttons (after using this product I can say the ideal place for these would be in the upper left-hand corner ; thank you for this lesson FAVI as I will keep it in mind while I'm searching for your product's replacement) This was my first attempt at the ultimate HTPC keyboard/mouse, and after using it, I can say this product was good at pointing out all the flaws of these types of devices in today's market",range
"My last complaint is another that might be out of the price range, but it would have been nice to have user-defined shortcuts and keyboard combinations and the ability to re-map the mouse-click buttons (see previous)",range
"There's one amount of force to push it down, then a strange stop",range
The strange key resistance is unacceptable,range
"This strangely seems to be regardless of range; the device worked great with a good line-of-sight up to 30 feet away, through a window",range
"It's not a range problem, happens the same way anywhere between 3' and 15'",range
"Ok so it works great from close range but in my situation, this thing falls flat on its face",range
I sent my device back and got a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 for a couple bucks extra which does EXACTLY what I wanted at a longer range,range
I used the Cideko Wireless Air Keyboard and Gyro Mouse Combo before trying this Logitech and have returned to the Cideko as the range is much greater,range
i did no know so i bought one easy to use 30ft range comes with mouse and right and left click buttons cons: light weight feels cheep with the mouse pad in the way it slows down your typing speed you need to hold down the shift key to shift,range
"This set will probably become my desktop control for my laptop when I can actually afford a decent qwerty remote - at which point this lag - if it still happens within a much closer range, will probably annoy me a great deal more",range
"If this problem with the keyboard persists when I start using it with my laptop, at much closer range, I will definitely revise my review and my rating",range
I had one of these and sold it because of the key arrangements that are mentioned in other reviews,range
I sit about 13-14 feet from the receiver but the functional range is more like 10-12 feet otherwise it is erratic,range
"I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller squished-together arrow keys",range
The newly sized and arranged directional arrows are impossible to correctly hit without first hitting every other key around them,range

The newly sized and arranged directional arrows are impossible to correctly hit without first hitting every other key around them,range
"In order to get the Rii mini to respond, I would have to lean forward in the couch because I was at the very edge of the operating range",range
I mapped it out and the max range in which the remote responds reliably is about 8 feet,range
I needed a 10 feet range and this product couldnt deliver it (which is very sad),range
"On a plus note, the device worked great when it was in range",range
The status lights don't work - The drag and drop won't work - the auto shutoff for the backlighting does not work - the range is 3 feet up to 9 if I place the dongle and hold the keyboard just right - the backlighting is uneven behind the keys - not all keys make good contact - and those are just preliminary observations - the inept lack of ergonomics makes it seem like it was built by a committee of hair-brained wannabe sub-nerds - I took the chance and lost,range
"It seems to work fairly decent, range is ok",range
"The arrangement of the Home/Page Up/Page Dn/End/Delete/Insert and arrow keys may allow the keyboard to fit in trays, but otherwise it is insane",range
* Range seemed acceptable--was using it at about 7-9 foot range,range
I really can't imagine what sort of catastrophic design failure would lead to all these strange events,range
One department in our hospital loves these keyboards for some strange reason,range
I read some of the lower reviews and was hoping that mine would not have the range issues that some people were having,range
"After a year of using this product, the letter ""B"" no longer works, which is strange because I rarely use the letter B",range
"Although attractively designed and potentially ideal for home theater use, this unit has such a limted transmission range that it cannot be recommended",range
"Also, even though they say the range is 30 feet, it's stupid because 2",range
4ghz devices will eat the hell out of battery at this range,range
"I find it strange since we invented typewriters, the QWERTY keyboard has survived this long while the typewriter manufacturers never created an ""ergonomically styled typewriter""? [find, invented, has, survived, created, styled] [strange, long]

"The only reason i say this is because I have the logitech dongle plugged in my computer and the device works in EVERY room in the house even the garage, you will not get this kind of range with the Rii Portable",range
The range is good enough for me; about 12 feet,range
"The only aspect that is really, really annoying is the arrangement of the 4 arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN)-- the separate arrow keys that are not embedded in the number pad",range
"The arrow keys are unusually small, and the arrangement is weired",range
I'd pay for extra $ to improve this key arrangement or have the usual arrow key arrangement at the expense of the separate number pad,range
"I agree the shape of the keyboard, key arrangement and palm rest are very comfortable, but the basics went wrong here",range
I've found the range to be acceptable but not outstanding,range
Actual maximum range is about 6-8' (same as regular wireless keyboard) 2,range
"However, I've used many computer keyboards in this price range, and they've seemed positively luxurious by comparison",range
My work arrangements require me to divide my time between a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard (at home) and various standard keyboards,range

hard to type and range is good no more than five feet away,range
It has pretty good range,range
the range is also good,range
"I decided to replace the keyboard, and just moved up to a higher price range (expecting higher quality) and a different brand (Logitech)via Amazon",range
Then it started spraying out random keypresses and control characters which caused many windows to open and strange characters entered in dialog boxes,range
"However, be aware that Microsoft decided to rearrange several clusters of keys on this keyboard",range
I had to use a USB extension cable and put the receiver way up high on my entertainment unit in order to get a good response range,range
I get ~2 foot range if I am lucky,range
"Size is perfect, operation & sensitivity are OK - providing you're in range (which IMO is quite a bit shorter than they advertise)",range
"I do appreciate that the numberpad and the function keys (Insert, Delete, Home, etc) are in the traditional arrangement",range
"I really struggled giving this one star, but without a reasonable range, or any range at all, it renders the whole thing useless",range
The range is excellent,range
"Besides making those keys smaller than older boards, I see no reason for them to have rearranged them, but I'm sure that in time my hands will get used to it",range
"If the manufacturer had built in a 30ft range and maintained a bit more quality control I've have bought a second, but as it is I'm taking advantage of Amazon's return policy and sending it back",range
"They keys are arranged in a straight rectangle fashion, not staggered like a regular qwerty keyboard, so it's often unintuitive to type on it",range
"The HTPC is using wireless networking, and it's clear that the more network traffic there is, the worse the reception is for the remote (not surprising since they are using the same frequency range)",range
"I've read other reviews saying they get much better range, but certainly not out of mine! ['ve, read, saying, get] [other, better]

"Its wireless range is good, as I have no connection problem within 20 feet away from the PC",range
"I think they are sending out the bad (literally the range was 2 feet from the receiver) units on purpose, as most people won't pay to ship them back for a replacement",range
"To make matters worse the reduced-size cursor keys are not in the usual inverted T, but in a cruciform arrangement, which makes this keyboard pretty useless for people who engage in FPS games like Quake 2/3, Unreal etc",range
"Second, I was really frustrated with the range of this device at first",range
Finally I found that I get good range if I hold the device so that the back faces the HTPC,range

"Still, the keyboard is reliable, cheap, and has great range",range
"The Natural also gets high marks in that the keys are quiet, they are arranged in the correct standard of 104 or so key layout, so if you are a developer, you know exactly where the keys are going to be (as far as special symbols, namely the ""|"" key, the arrow keys, and the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", etc) are in their correct locations",range
"So many of the interesting models of ergonomic keyboards re-arrange the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", ""End"", etc keys that it makes the keyboard awkward",range
"Bottom line: A very good wireless keyboard and mouse combo for the price range, but heavy typers may want to look for something a bit more wear-resistant, and with a more classical layout",range
"This is my first ergonomic keyboard, and although it feels kinda strange, I know it will worth in the long run, but the space key is the worst I've ever seen",range
Fully charged the wireless range is about 2',range
"I do transcription work, I haven't been able to become fully adjusted to the arrangement of the keys",range
"It actually did work as advertised, and I found the range to be better than the average wireless device",range
I figure the actual range on this unit is aprox less then 2 feet,range
"PROs + Size is excellent, smaller than a typical tv remote + Keyboard is very compact but the keys are large enough to be usable + Touchpad is a key advantage of the design and is big enough to be usable + Mouse keys and arrow bottons are well placed, below the touchpad + Range is fine (some reviewers criticized range but I had no problems, see note below on line of sight) + Battery life is good CONs - Keys are poor quality and often stick or require multiple touches to register (sometimes you press a key once and have it fill the screen with the same character, other times you have to press the same key 4 or 5 times to get anything) - Touchpad often is not responsive (when it works it's great but often it doesn't and you have to turn it off and on again) - Appears to require line of sight connection with USB receiver",range
"It does have a nice feeling keystroke, the range and accuracy of the wireless seems excellent, and the touchpad (the reason I bought this model vs",range

",range
"would be nice if the mouse buttons were on the other side of the keyboard so with one finger can operate track pad, then other hand have mouse buttons",pad
"It works (connects easily and every time) and it's nice to have the laptop style trackpad built-in, unfortunately the keys are cramped for serious typing",pad
"MS keyboards (especially this one) are very wide and use a ton of space to the right of the arrow keys, mainly for the number pad",pad
"Look for something that doesn't use an idiotic F-lock design, and get a keyboard without (or with a detachable) number keypad section, so your hand can get to the mouse more easily",pad
""" It's at least 3 inches wider (and a lot bulkier) than my old standard Dell keyboard, not counting the wrist pad or elevating stand",pad
The wrist pad feels nice but picks up debris really easily,pad
I'm going to try the other Rii device w/ blu tooth and the touch pad in the middle,pad
Supposedly that touch pad is adjustable,pad
"4 Ghz Super Long Range (30m Max) Removable Battery Htpc Ipad with Connection Kits Full Qwerty Keyboard Adjustable Dpi Touchpad for Pc, Apple, Xbox360, Ps3)   Had it for 3 months now, love it",pad
"The track pad is decent, you can even game with it",pad
"The other ""extra"" keys haven't gotten much use yet, but as I ramp up the keyboard's use for work -- and Excel -- I think I'll really like the extra numeric keypad keys (parens and equals)",pad
I needed an illuminated quiet wireless keyboard with a touchpad,pad
The touchpad is not functional and keys appear to stick or just don't respond at all,pad
"Pros: - perfect ergonomics - nice leather wrist padding Cons: - noisy spacebar - spacebar presses harder then letter keys - F-keys devided into two groups, while classically it should be three - a bit large Could be perfect without issue with spacebar",pad
"We really need a touch pad due to reduce strain on our hands, but this keyboard only added new strains",pad
The touch pad is not as jerky and seldom double taps when not intended,pad
One clue is that the System Profiler claimed to be able to see the device when the USB dongle was plugged in even though the computer stopped responding to keystrokes or the touchpad,pad
The track pad is decent for most purposes but utterly useless for games requiring a mouse,pad
At first most of the keys were jumbled up so whenever I would type something it was displayed wrong on my computer screen for instance if I hit the 6 button on the numeric keypad it would display,pad
"Has some but not all ""F"" keys and a dedicated Ctrl+Alt+Del key Cons: Placement of the touchpad is OK but seems to hinder your typing some, Touchpad not very responsive with sensitivity all the way up",pad
Overall if you can put up with it possibly going dead after a few months and realize that the touchpad is only useful if you have nothing else it's OK but I most likely am not going to repurchase another one,pad
"When it works as advertised, the keyboard is great, touchpad and keyboard makes web surfing from the couch enjoyable",pad
I would actually like the touch-pad centered under the keyboard like a laptop,pad
"OK, it is a keyboard with a touch pad that is wireless and works through a small USB receiver",pad
The curve of the keypad layout is slightly better than the traditional linear design of those freebies,pad
"Pros ++ Keyboard installs itself on Vista or later and all extra keys work with the basic drivers ++ Key layout is curved slightly, good for those who don't want a full split keyboard ++ Integrated number pad is a nice extra for a budget keyboard ++ Quiet key action will suit those who don't like loud ""clicky"" keyboards ++ CTRL Shortcuts are starred under common keys like x, c, v, b, u, I, & f, making this a good learning keyboard ++ Additional extra keys include the normal function keys, back, forward, music controls and 3 extras (web/home, search & mail) ++ There's even a calculator shortcut button built-in ++ Keyboard's lower profile is much thinner than most ergonomic keyboards ++ Lowest cost in an ergonomic keyboard makes this an option for those on a budget Cons -- Plastic body is noticeably cheap -- Keys have little tactile feedback, making this unpleasant to use for longer periods -- Not curved enough for those who prefer full split ergonomic designs -- Keys are sticker prints that will eventually wear off (typical of low cost keyboards) -- High failure rates (also typical of low cost keyboards ALTERNATIVES It's a challenge to find decent results with ergonomic or split keyboards in this price range",pad
Not only are the curves natural and well molded but the minimally padded leather-imitation wrist-rest offers a silky sense of luxury,pad
My biggest problems is trying to use shortcuts is all but impossible as the mousepad gets in the way and the charge doesn't seem to last all that long if it's actually being used for anything more than typing a quick URL or using the mouse for a few quick clicks,pad
"MS did some things right: It's in black (gone are the days of the beige box), power user keys a re included, the keyboard now has a base tilt, and finally rest pad",pad
"Also, the 4000 is far more comfortable on the palms with its addition of padding",pad
"The good: + small + light + no reception issues + very tiny USB dongle + convenient volume control + it has a touch pad + Perfect if you are sitting in front of your TV and have to write an email, do a google search, etc",pad
The numeric key pad and the regular typewriter keys are fine,pad
In summary: Pro: Ergonomics are good Typewriter keys and numeric keypad are fine Con: arrow keys and navigation keys are too small and in a non-standard position keyboard is wobbly and little flimsy keys are a little mushy when pressed,pad
That's not all as the keyboard also had at least 1/2 sec input lag in the touchpad and the left touchpad button was mushy and did not click when I pressed it and also had problems registering the key press in the first place,pad
I do wish they had kept the editing keys and dispensed with the num pad altogether so that the keyboard wouldn't take up so much desk space,pad
"BOTTOM LINE:  If you want a production usage, moderate to heavy typing, wireless keyboard with a mouse pad, DO NOT GET THIS ONE",pad
"BECAUSE I will be using my old wireless FULL size, non-mouse pad, keyboard rather than this too small of a one for my typing, I am personally giving this 1 out of 5",pad
"Ah, but it is only almost full size when you include the touchpad",pad
"The touchpad works find, but overall the keyboard it too lightweight for effective typing from one's lap",pad
"Next, I was surprised to find that the touch pad is multi-touch",pad
"Also the keyboard is huge, and if you're not a big number pad user and you're right handed, it puts the mouse waaaaay too far to the right to be covenient or comfortable",pad
There's a big mouse pad,pad
"Because it's a small area, you have no choice but to pick up your thumb and move it back onto the pad sometimes and this can be interpreted as a ""click""",pad
The keypad itself is nice it feels good and is responsive etc,pad
for some reason (maybe oils from my finger) the touch mouse pad likes to move on its own and move the webpage back in history to previously viewed webpages,pad
This will work great as a backup keyboard when the full sized Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad (920-003070) arrives,pad
"Until then, when I get sick of trying to hone in on an ""ok"" button with this mouse, I switch to an iPhone app that works as a trackpad or just use VNC",pad
"Of course the keypad del key is important to enter into the BIOS on a lot of motherboards, so you can't do that with this keyboard",pad
"Keyboard and trackpad seem to work fine, however I wish the backlight was brighter",pad
Extra keys above number pad are useful and make sense,pad
"Plus, the padded wrist rest feels nice and is sloped nicely",pad
"On the first day I got this keypad thing, I noticed that the lazer pointer didn't work",pad
"Mouse works great most of the time, mut it will suddenlyu freeze up and it may take as many as 17 swishes on the pad before it movesd",pad
"As is the case with other mouse pads, it also struggles to discern the difference between putting one's finger in the pad and a tap-click",pad
then i went and found another wireless keyboard with a touchpad and they canceled my order,pad
"All keys (including left and right click under the touchpad), backlight, and laser pointer still work",pad
"Got the perfect touchpad sensitivity in the first shipment, but there was something wrong with one of the keys",pad
I thought it was just a lemon because the touchpad sensitivity was perfect in the first one,pad
"After 2 more exchanges, I realized it was the ""normal"" touchpad",pad
"It would have been nice if the touchpad had multi-touch and scrolling capabilities, but I realize it is an inexpensive unit",pad
"Yes, you can set the touchpad to operate at 90 degress (to use one handed, like a TV remote), but the mouse-click buttons don't switch, with the right-click button the more natural to press",pad
"Everything on the right size is shrunken down to make room for the trackpad, but it's infuriating to type on",pad
They honestly should have just made it a NORMAL sized keyboard and just omitted the numeric keypad to make room for the trackpad,pad
"The keyboard and touch-pad work very well, but the receiver is line-of-sight",pad
"It's compact, has a full keyboard with a logical layout of keys, has an effective touchpad with a scrolling zone on the right side, and has great backlighting and battery life",pad
"I've gotten used to it, but it would have been nice if the trackpad woke up the device ((the trackpad will not respond until clicking a key)",pad
"The trackpad, although small, can cover the screen in about 3 swipes",pad
"Also, typing is a bit awkward with the right hand to stretch over the touchpad but you should expect that given the layout",pad
"Pros: -nice design, nice size, feels good to hold and type on with your index fingers -laster pointer a bonus -backlight a plus -adjustable touchpad is a nice feature -compatible with linux -ability to change rf channels -decent price Cons: -very weak signal, inconsistent, signal will break depending on the orientation of the device Unfortunately I cannot recommend this device to anybody seeking a wireless keyboard",pad
"Both devices showed up in the same package with no padding for shipping of any sort, just a simple envelope",pad
The Track pad on my android tablet though tracks wonky side to side is up and down and up and down are side to side,pad
"The keys are grid shaped, not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys",pad
"Laser works, light up keyboard works ok, buttons work ok, mouse pad works ok, but nothing works really well",pad
"The smaller remotes with an integrated keypad promised to be far too awkward, so I went with this product because of the Logitech name",pad
"The sensitivity seems to vary randomly and, when moving my finger across the pad to relocate the cursor, it often performs a ""hold the left button down to drag"" function, forcing me to hit the escape key and start again",pad
Very convienent having track pad built-in,pad
"Trackpad - it's very nice to be able to sit back on the couch and not need to worry about a mouse while browsing Netflix, etc",pad
"Trackpad - the buttons have a soft click to them, and the texture is mottled and just wasn't super comfortable for me",pad
"Additionally, the trackpad is garbage and hard to use on a Windows 7 environment",pad
"It's really a shame, as Favi could do very well in the HTPC keyboard market if they put a little care in their keyboard design using HTC examples, in addition to replacing the crap-o-la trackpad with an optical-pad (again found on the G2 phone)",pad
"The touch pad does the job but the right and left click should be on the left side, not by the touch pad",pad
the touchpad works great although i havent figured out (or even read the manual,pad
it feels very light and im missing the number keypad but i guess ill have to get used to that,pad
"When it did work, the touchpad took a while to get used to as it has a smaller surface area than a laptop touchpad (scrolling around on your PC at max resolution was a lot of work)",pad
"*2 people have managed to pop a numpad key off that will not go back on, may or may not be product at fault",pad
"5 stars 2nd purchase: left touchpad button much better, works most of the time, but still no comparison to Apple's or Synaptic's touchpads with which you pretty much forget you're using them at all because they are so perfectly ergonomic that they totally merge into one's work-flow",pad
"The touchpad however is awesome in both, Windows and Mac OS, incl",pad
"The additional left-click button in the top left is a creative invention I sometime find myself using :) 1st purchase/ old comment: gosh, can the trackpad's left button pretty much be called (semi) defective? [is, find, using, left, be, called] [additional, left-click, top, creative, old, defective]
",pad
"I have to press the button *really* hard while one-finger dragging on the touchpad, otherwise the drag operation interrupts: a window drag stops, dragged content (files, folders etc",pad
"It would simply be better if the click buttons weren't on the same side as the touchpad so you could hold down the click button with one hand and use the touchpad with the other hand for situations requiring scrolling, dragging, or selecting multiple objects etc",pad
"I don't like it because, you have to wait on it while it scrolls whereas using the click button and the touchpad would be faster and more accurate",pad
The typing and touchpad are all functional,pad
The trackpad location would be OK if the mouse buttons were on the opposite end,pad
"Instead, they are right below the trackpad, which significantly slows down the speed at which you can perform move/click operations and makes dragging virtually impossible",pad
"The D-pad below the trackpad is nice for navigating WMC menus, but would be a heck of a lot more useful with a dedicated Enter button in the middle",pad
The trackpad is not the kind you are used to on your laptop--it seems overly sensitive or under-sensitive,pad
"The idea is great, 4 or 5 stars for that, the design of the keyboard, touchpad, etc",pad
"Unless you have have tiniest pinky pad in the world - good luck controlling your cursor - it is like playing a random ""catch the pointer""",pad
The only thing I don't like is the numeric pad,pad
"Does anyone know of a keyboard that is like this (gentle curve, low profile) but missing the numeric pad? [know, is, missing] [gentle, low, numeric]
",pad
"Bigger, but smaller than a normal sized keyboard and an integrated touchpad",pad
"There are nice touches, such as the scroll knob in the middle of the keyboard and the padded palm rest",pad
"Like the title states, I really wanted this to work, a nice lighted keypad, with a touch pad for my bedroom HTPC would have been nice to have, it was a good size and felt nice in the hands, however it just did not work and I am not going to try another one based on the bad reviews",pad
I sit comfortably on my sofa and its as responsive as the track pad on your laptop,pad
"The product works well, the touchpad is responsive and scrolling was a neat feature",pad
"On the upside, this keyboard does look very nice and feels very good to rest my palms on the cushioned pad",pad
"Because of the small size of the track pad, you have to turn the mouse speed up quite high to be able to move from one side of the screen to the other with one or two swipes, but then it is so sensitive that it is hard to control precisely",pad
"The track pad is really only acceptable for GUI, not gaming",pad
"To right-click you have to stop what you're doing onscreen, look at the pad on the right, locate the dang right-click button and click it",pad
"Pros: * Backlit keys * Mouse pad that works in both orientations * rechargable * very small and portable * useless laser pointer (maybe a con also as the kids might shoot each other in the face with it) * fairly cheap Cons: - limited range, like 10 feet at best - mine wont connect using the extension cable, must plug directly into machine",pad
"In general this is a good keyboard: * comfortable wrist pads * excellent ergonomic positioning of the keys * plug and play in windows 7 - I did not install the software that came with keyboard and all the keys I ever use work without it (including volume up/down, play/pause etc",pad
"The concept is good, having (almost) a full keyboard and a touch-pad in a device of the same size as a regular remote-control",pad
Features are great including new keys introduced above keypad and soft handrest,pad
"* improve the touch pad or replace it with either a trackball or a trackpoint joystick * improve wireless signal so I wouldn't have to buy a USB extension cable to mount the receiver to the top of my TV * the ""world's first Touchpad 90-degree flip design"" is a worthless feature for this keyboard",pad
"The laser and flippable touchpad aim at presenters, the keyboard and small form factor appeal to HTPC users, however this keyboard kinda misses the mark on both accounts",pad
"It was wonderful to put my hands on the wristpad (which was lightly padded and covered with faux leather--it's really better than it sounds), ready to type",pad
"The only aspect that is really, really annoying is the arrangement of the 4 arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN)-- the separate arrow keys that are not embedded in the number pad",pad
I'd pay for extra $ to improve this key arrangement or have the usual arrow key arrangement at the expense of the separate number pad,pad
"A wireless handheld (QWERTY)keyboard with touchpad and laser pointer,  bought with thoughts of computing while removed from immediate proximity to my monitors/keyboards and not having to balance a  fullsize keyboard in my lap",pad

"The wrist pad feels very soft and comfortable, and my hands don't hurt after long periods of typing",pad
Combine that with the small mouse pad and keyboard and you have to get up and point the device to get it to go more than 10ft away,pad
End of story I returned this crap quality device for a small logitech K400 unit a bit larger with full size keyboard and trackpad built in,pad
But after 6 months or so several keys stopped working (colon/semicolon + some keypad keys) despite only light use and no spills,pad
"Occasionally I will hit the 'new' equals sign instead of NumLock (there is a separated row of four buttons atop the number keypad) Rarely will I use the keyboard's back button (think mouse) as it is more conveniently reached that the forward key [for me] -- even with ""big"" hands",pad
"If that is not an issue, and you require neither key tap resistance, nor key tap click feedback then you will be happy with this natural keyboard -- the additional 'curve' of the keys offered no challenge to me already familiar with microsoft natural keyboards,  I appreciate the 'front loaded' height of the keyboard, but the padding leaves much to be desired",pad
One can feel pad flex with considerable applied pressure but if you're looking for a cushy wrist- or palm rest please consider buying an additional pad,pad
"(Guys, is it really that big a deal to add a few pennies' worth of padding to these things? [is, add] [big, few]
",pad
A few months of use and now the touchpad and keyboard have stopped working,pad
The touchpad is really good,pad
Similar to Apple touch pads where you use one finger to move the cursor around and two fingers for scrolling,pad
What you are paying for here is a good touchpad and a small/compact keyboard,pad
"Many times to even use the touchpad I have to press random buttons to get the device to connect, then I can use the touchpad",pad
I like the padded wrist rest but that's all I like,pad
"I was excited about buying a keyboard with a touchpad so I could ditch my wireless mouse, however, I do a lot of actual office work with it, and it drives me absolutely CRAZY that the right shift key is not full size! [was, excited, buying, do, drives, CRAZY, is] [wireless, actual, right, full]
",pad
"I like the idea f the keybard, and the tw finger swipe fr the musepad wrks really well, but if I cannt use a keybard as a keybard",pad
"The keyboard is ok, but the numeric keypad on the right has quit functioning",pad
"The touchpad is ok, pretty much on par with laptop touch pads I've used",pad
As a left handed person I would really appreciate one with the keypad on the left,pad
"It's comfortable in the hand, the keys give a nice tactile feedback when pressing them, the touchpad works great, the backlight works great",pad
"I managed to get fairly comfortable two-thumb typing on the device, and the touchpad was a dream to use on the HTPC",pad
Use: I wanted a full keyboard that was wireless with trackpad,pad
"Cons: I don't like the design on the trackpad, the left click is tricky, it receieves a 'click' just fine but 'click and hold' requires a bit of pressure, the cursor key positions are very inconvenient for me",pad
Not only are the curves natural and well molded but the minimally padded leather-imitation wrist-rest offers a silky sense of luxury,pad
Its because of the section where the mouse pad is puts a distance between your right thumb and the alpha keys,pad
"The product works exactly as described, but there are two problems I've had with the design: * There is no scroll on the side of the trackpad like all the other trackpads I use",pad
"This may not sound like a big deal, but the major reason I use the keyboard/trackpad is to surf the internet on my TV",pad
One finger scroll on the right like on a Synaptic pad would be fine,pad
* Typing is hard because the trackpad on the right side gets in the way,pad
This is a cool little RF wireless keyboard and mouse/touchpad,pad
The touch pad is also great - although I did crank up the sensitivity,pad
"Overall I'm happy with this keyboard because of it's size, price and overall good touch pad",pad
The keyboard itself and the touchpad are great,pad
"The spacebar requires an unusual amount of force, compared to the rest of the keypads",pad
The spacebar keypad measures five and one-half inches in length but is only most responsive at its center,pad
":>}  Either use the ""enter"" key on the number pad (you'll learn a lot about muscle motor memory if you do) or buy a new unit",pad
"It was a pretty great deal for what I was going to use it as, just simply a keyboard and touchpad to give me some room on my desk",pad
"They keyboard was built pretty well, it looked pretty nice and it had a kind of cool funky design on the touchpad",pad
"This keyboard is small, comes with a touchpad, laser pointer and above all is blue tooth",pad
The trackpad seems responsive and allows for tap clicking but no multitouch,pad
It KINDA felt like typing on a phone but my normal right hand movements were impeded by the space that the trackpad was in,pad
I really wanted that tiny keyboard/touchpad to complete my HTPC build,pad
"I do appreciate that the numberpad and the function keys (Insert, Delete, Home, etc) are in the traditional arrangement",pad
"The buttons have a nice feel, and the trackpad works quite well",pad
"The trackpad is a good size making it useful, but still allowing the keyboard to be small",pad
"The touch pad mouse is just fine, for what it is, and the 2 thumb typing on this board  is actually pretty good",pad
So I use the arrow key functions on the keypad and am getting used to switching the NumLock button on/off,pad
Being the owner of both a home server and a HTPC this seemed like the answer to my dream of a pair of full featured micro keyboards with a trackpad and I was excited to give one a go,pad
i can still navigate fine without the touchpad but this keyboard lost a major capability without touchpad,pad
"The layout is decent, and the trackpad is actually pretty good- if all you need is a wireless mouse, it does ""ok""",pad
For styling reasons the bottom row of keys become progressively smaller toward the right side in order to visually align with the arrow keys and number pad,pad
"Mostly the issues are trying to navigate with the tiny mouse-pad, and not accidentally clicking everything the cursor is on, bad if you have 1-Click set-up on Amazon",pad
Then the option to adjust the touchpad orientation from vertical to horizontal is too cool,pad
Even when the letters were worn off the keypads it never made any loud clunking or thumping sounds,pad
I was attracted by the built in touch pad and found that to have disappointing performance,pad
"I wasn't expecting it to be wonderful I admit and I think that I was disappointed to some degree because I generated an expectation for myself that I'd be able to use the touch pad with my thumb, but it doesn't work that way and probably never was intended too either",pad
The touchpad is fine for basic mouse clicks and navigation,pad
"You also cannot two-finger-pinch-zoom on the touchpad like you do on iOS devices, MacBook, or newer PC laptops",pad
"And the lack of a numeric pad, not even an Fn-extended numeric pad, would further hamper an office user",pad
"The regular button under the touchpad is a little more solid, but the same thing happens occasionally",pad
The location of the mouse buttons is pretty odd because you will most likely be using your right thumb on the track pad while your left hand is sitting idle on the left side of the remote,pad
I would swipe my finger across the trackpad and it would react after a second or more,pad
"Since your hand and fingers are not typically positioned in a way that is also exactly parallel to the sides of the touchpad, scrolling can be inconsistent",pad
"As a desktop replacement keyboard, this is not the greatest solution, but there are few products that include an integrated touchpad",pad
"Touchpad had crisp response and seemed to work well even with my larger hands (I'm 6'-0"")",pad
It seemed like a decent choice since it had wireless and also a touch pad attached which would spare me from having to awkwardly try to use a mouse on my sofa when needed,pad
I would have much preferred the arrow keys placed under the touch pad buttons than in its current location,pad
"com/gp/product/B003UE52ME/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/182-1486758-9604328"">Rii Mini Wireless Keyboard with Touchpad (RT-MWK01)</a> Receiver dongle USB plug and play loops connecting and disconnecting over and over again every second on Windows and Linux, defective",pad
"good size, and the touchpad is very good",pad
"Second: there is little difference between the height and feeling of the ""mouse"" keys for left and right clicks and the height of the touchpad",pad
They are especially needed when the height difference between them and the keyboard and the touchpad are all very similar,pad
"I've been trying to use this keyboard for a few weeks, and just like my Revue keyboard that I've had for a year, I am pressing down on the touchpad at times thinking I am on the left-click button",pad
"com/gp/product/B005JR1LXE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/176-6700503-9867209"">RII Mini Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard - Compatible with Apple iPad PC and Mac , Built-in Touchpad Mouse, Backlit Display and Laser Pointer</a>)to see if it does better with range",pad
"The backspace key is narrower than normal, and there is no numeric keypad",pad
Layout is good but it is a little awkward reaching over the touch pad on the right to type,pad
The touch pad is the same way,pad
So  i purchased this product it works great with the keys and everything it just the touchpad it randomly wouldnt respond it was extremely irritating and i would recommend you look around for different wireless keyboards,pad
It wasn't worth hassling with a return so I simply modified it with a bit of duct tape on the bottom front right pad,pad
"The touchpad has a decent size and responds well, but it barely qualifies as multi touch",pad
Think of this as a basic wireless keyboard with a trackpad built in,pad
"Pros Works out of the box Price was decent Feels Decently solid Cons Small size makes it a bit awkward to use 25% larger would have been nice The mouse pad is way to small and it's location on the device often gets in the way Overall, works for now",pad
"It comes with a leather wristpad, a zoom lever, buttons to adjust volume, and it looks damn good in black",pad
"The Natural 4000 shines in that it is very comfortable as the wrist rest area has built in pads with a soft leatherette feel, the keys are quiet, and we see a return to the front riser which alleviates wrist strain due to it assisting in keeping your wrists straight",pad
It was replacing one of those laptop sized keyboard/touch pad combination devices for controlling XBMC,pad
"In this regard it works well, but it is somewhat hard to get about using the touch pad",pad
But the touch pad was perfectly clean,pad
My only complaint is that the rubber pads that keep the keyboard from sliding around on your desk keep coming off and when they don't come off they leave black marks on my desktop,pad
"I will probably end up removing and adding my own rubber pads to the bottom to this keyboard, because I love everything else about it",pad
The whole point was making an egronomic workspace which is defeated if I have to move my arm to a different level to use the mouse or track pad,pad
I purchased this for remote use with an Acer pad computer,pad
"poorly I hate to slam the product itself because it's trying to accomplish something that I don't think is possible: Combine a full keyboard, touchpad and multimedia controls into a compact unit with great battery life",pad
"I'm sure they designed it this way for durability reasons, but it lowers the usability of the touchpad",pad
"Even with practice it takes me 2-3x longer to mouse around the screen with it (compared to say, a Macbook touchpad)",pad
"The touchpad works for a few moments just fine, then just hangs",pad
"The biggest pains are the number 6 key, and the distance between the arrow keys and the alpha keypad",pad
This keyboard is small and responsive except for the left mouse button under the touchpad,pad
"It's black, so shows less finger grime, and I like the cushioned wrist pads",pad
#NAME?,pad
"If they would purchase a better designed keypad and put it in a smaller keyboard and use the same gel wrist pad, it would improve it a lot",pad
"also, i dont like the design on the mouse pad, plain black would have been better",pad
"It does have a nice feeling keystroke, the range and accuracy of the wireless seems excellent, and the touchpad (the reason I bought this model vs",pad
"It's some how seperated from the rubber spring pad under it, so every time I press it, it makes a loud clicking noise",pad
"It's not, however, sufficient as a primary trackpad",pad
"You can easily find wireless USB and wireless Bluetooth iterations of its design as well, here at Amazon (and on eBay), but the hard USB cable connection sends a very accurate signal from a touchpad of near-ideal sensitivity",pad
"
",pad
"The internet was continuously going out for no apparent reason, and we knew it had to be either the router/PC cards, or Comcast's signal (the cable modem itself was functioning properly)",signal
"Sure the signal was stronger after i installed the Range Expander, but it was less reliable do to all the dropped connections",signal
It is almost like the silent recalls on autos - they probably feel it is not worth it to resolve this issue Hooking the computer directly to the Comcast cable modem by ethernet resolves all lost signal problems  - so I know it is the Linksys router,signal
"Pros:   Strong signal, will feed your all your neighbors with wifi",signal
Router was easy to set up and configure with good strong signal,signal
"Without putting much thought into its position (it is a floor below where I typically connect to it from), my signal strength ranges from 'very good' to 'excellent' (so says windows)",signal
"I can't connect to internet wirelessly, despite strong cable signal",signal
I have a small low-signal zone in one corner of my house and I thought this product would be the perfect solution,signal
"Before installing this, I had about a 10% signal at any given time, and it would take about 2 minutes to download 10 megs or so, which is REALLY slow given my cable connection",signal
"After the incredibly difficult (I have set up quite a few wireless networks before, and I do IT consulting for a living, so I can only imagine how difficult this must be for someone without networking knowledge to install) setup process, my signal downstairs did improve dramatically, to 95%, but the speed seemed to be reduced even further, to the point where it was near unusable",signal
"Interestingly, the 5GHz signal is fine, but not all devices support 5GHz (iPhone, iPod, etc do not)",signal
"Both routers I tried were Version-B; however, even though the wireless connection showed 11mpbs, 100% signal strength (since I was only 3feet away), yet was very slow, about 2k transfer from the internet",signal
"I have two areas I wanted better signal and I can't seem to place it in an area where it improve both areas at the same time, so I move it 15 ft one direction or the other depending on what area I want to use",signal
"After I changed all those settings back, and disabled my wireless router's encryption, used the Auto Config to make the repeater both lights blue (signaling ok to connected to my wireless router)",signal
"In one corner of my house, my computer was able to pick up the router's signal, but this repeater couldn't! [was, pick] [able]
",signal
GPS has a very difficult time receiving a signal,signal
For multiple laptops and a powerful signal spend $20 more and buy a Linksys,signal
"The set-up was easy and the hard-wired part of the router worked, but it didn't broadcast any wireless signal",signal
"It also puts out such a strong signal that you might not even need a repeater for your current dead spots! [puts, need] [strong, current, dead]
",signal
It was difficult to get a satlelite signal and it locked up,signal
Unfortunately it didn't increase the signal strength and it kept fading in and out,signal
The only good thing I see with this is good wireless signal strength,signal
If you are using this for just chat and email this is probably an okay router with pretty good signal strength,signal
signal was strong but there was no Internet connection,signal
It shows I am connected and it shows I have a strong signal but I am unable to do anything and the little monitor in the task pane indicates it isn't doing anything,signal
2-3 minutes later my laptop will connect to the RE and I am back online with a good signal,signal
"The Belkin router won out for three reasons: First, it beat the D-Link in range (distance) tests: It was able to sustain a wireless signal across a greater distance and at a greater strength than the D-Link DIR-655",signal
I had this router for 2 months and it stopped sending out the wireless signal,signal
This device worked well for about 8 months boosting an open signal from a WRT54G router,signal
I purchased a laptop from Dell and it received the signal much stronger from anywhere in the house without the range expander than my PC did with it,signal
"The GPS unit is impressive, but mine kept dropping the satellite signal and recalculating to a different destination",signal
"I could connect a few feet away, but walk 10 feet and the signal started to fade",signal
"4 firmware, I am currently running at between about 36% and 52% signal strength, which provides a minimum of 36 mbps, higher than the maximum 27 mbps (54/2) that the WRE54g can deliver",signal
"And, because my signal strength is lower, my signal is more difficult for intruders to detect and is less likely to cause interference with my neighboors",signal
"If you need more signal strength, consider Linksys's new high strength antenna",signal
"Except, my wireless pc upstairs saw the device and the signal boost",signal
"* The range of the router was really poor, and I had to purchase an additional anntennae for $50 to make the signal reach through several walls into my living room",signal
The signal must be very small or non existent,signal
No signal of life after one single day using it,signal
"Remember, even with a 10% signal strength, you are still able to surf the net without a hitch",signal
I replaced a Linksys wireless router in the same spot and signal strength is half or less,signal
"Overall, it does expand my network and gives me higher signal quality, especially when I run my microwave and washing machines which usually interfere with the wireless to some degree",signal
The signal are better than the D-Link 614+ I just bought,signal
"At first it seemed fine, but then it could not detect the signal",signal
"If I move to the bedroom which is about 25 feet away and has two walls in between, signal floats between medium, poor, and none",signal
I did have to move the unit around to get a good signal throughout my two story house,signal
It doesn't have any stronger of a signal than the cheap wireless router I was using,signal
Despite the 3 antennas not getting great signal strength on the next floor up,signal
"It took me less than a half hour to set up and get running with all three of my laptops (including using WEP security), and the signal from the D-Link router is much stronger throughout my house than the Linksys ever was",signal
"Now the internal adapter senses the network, but the signal strength is so low that it cannot sign on for more than a few seconds, if at all",signal
After I repositioned the Extender several times I finally did get a decent signal,signal
"If I don't, my computer shows an excellent signal but I have limited or no connectivity",signal
Pros: -- Great screen: the display is plenty large & bright to see easily Cons: -- Utterly unreliable in acquiring satellite signal,signal
"Leaving Cincy, I had my first taste of what was to become a week of frustration: it was unable to find any satellite signal",signal
"I'm on I-71 (flat terrain) on a perfectly clear day and it can't find a signal? ['m, find] [flat, clear]
",signal
"Two hours later, it finds signal again only to lose them in another two hours when I was on I-81 with another perfectly clear day",signal
"getting excellent signal strength all the way by my pool which is approx 45 feet away and behind several walls, tv's and computers",signal
Now I have no signal repeater and have lost the ability to get online with my laptop,signal
"I followed the directions carefully, and after about the 6th location in my house, I got the two flashing blue lights to go steady indicating it found my household wireless signal",signal
<p>Across the hall in the next room my Laptop is at 0%-3% signal on this thing,signal
Also signal doesn't seem very strong lots of times,signal
One nice feature that some of them add is a boost to the send/receive signal from the router,signal
"Both my laptop, pda cannot identy a wireless signal at all",signal
"I bought this because my router would not get signal to my bedroom, and it's only a single level house, 1800 sq ft",signal
"With the booster I had a very strong signal, but could not sign onto the Internet",signal
Same spot that we have always connected using the old router at full signal strength in both cards,signal
"The quickest route took me along 45 miles of two lane highway with several traffic signal, only to save 2 minutes over the freeway route! [took, save] [quickest, several]
",signal
"I called them because the brand new Wireless-G Range Expander (WRE54G) from Amazon was not providing a strong enough signal for my wireless laptop to pick up, even when they were side-by-side and in the same room as the wireless router",signal
"After a couple of days, I have a strong signal in every part of the house (2 stories) and usually a 54 Mbps connection",signal
I purchased the 3700 solely for the 5gz signal,signal
"Using multiple settings, updated firmware, more than one laptop, and searching various forums I could not get the 5gz to hold a steady signal",signal
"After about 2 hours of mixed signal, changing from dynamic to static DHCPs, etc, I called tech support",signal
Now it has very little signal strength,signal
I keep the router in my basement near my server and I can get a strong signal anywhere on my property,signal
"(7700 sqft lot with a 1850 sqft ranch house with full basement) I don't have any portable devices that use n yet, but my g devices all get strong signal now",signal
"Knowningly I use WRT54GS for router, and even bought HGA7T for ""supposively"" stronger signal strength",signal
I found G is better than N in range of signal,signal
"The TomTom just grays out the screen to indicate that it doesn't have reception but continues to plot your path at your last recorded speed, then gracefully picks up again when it regains a signal without distracting the user with a pointless button push",signal
"Matching speedbooster wireless card connects to the internet only when it feels like it, even in the same room as the router and with 100% signal strength",signal
The signal strength is good and the product is reasonably priced,signal
"The signal is strong, and it isn't a huge chunk out of your wallet to buy",signal
There's no real way to tell if this thing will grab a weak signal or not,signal
"The installation directions are simple if you don't put a security lock on the device, but I've been in situations with it when it grabs and amplifies the signal, and some when it does nothing",signal
"Robust, strong signal - what more could I want? [want] [strong]
",signal
"I bought the Netgear WGT624 wireless router and I get FULL signal, thats right, 99% signal where I only got 50-60% (if I was lucky) using my ""Expanded"" Linksys network (with the Linksys high gain antennas too! [bought, get, thats, got, was, using, Expanded] [wireless, FULL, lucky, high]
",signal
D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router signal strength was no more than half the linksys signal,signal
I setup my old LInksys in place of this and I can get a full signal in rooms where the Netgear doesn't even show up,signal
Wireless signal is VERY strong - just stops accessing the outside world,signal
"I noticed that any time my laptop detected multiple wireless signal, my wireless connection would fail",signal
"It only worked when I gave it to my parents, who live in a remote area where no other wireless signal can interfere with the Linksys wireless",signal
atleast for me as I sit about 12-15 feet from the router and get Excellent signal at 54 Mbps and can transfer large files(when it doesnt keep disconnecting) with amazing speeds,signal
"I had to purchase an additional reception antennae for the computer 45 ft away from the router in order to get ""good"" signal strength",signal
Then it took 5 minutes more to set up my 2nd computer to the wireless signal,signal
"I tried just about everything, including updating the latest firmware, but still no luck with signal improvement",signal
Although this isn't a long range router the signal reaches through my walls and into another room,signal
Many times I reset the router and the signal came back,signal
"This also includes some direct router connections, not just the wireless signal",signal
I get strong signal in my bed room closet that is at the other end of the house that WRT54G had trouble,signal
"As a concrete example, in the next room a mere 20 feet away with nothing in between other than a little drywall, I only get 2 signal bars on my Kindle",signal
There are four routers in my neighbors' surrounding houses which are penetrating my house with a stronger signal than this router IN the house,signal
"It doesn't supply a decent wireless signal within a regular house, even at short ranges",signal
Wirless signal very average and not upto its class as claimed in the product description 3,signal
"Email support was able to verify what I told them, that my router radio signal were defective",signal
Pros - easy setup Con - crap range and signal strength - overpriced - Broke after 3 months of use - unit is garabage,signal
"However, when I moved approximately 20 feet from the base, the quality of the signal was very poor and did not work",signal
My router simply decided to stop sending wireless signal a little over a year after I bought it,signal
Problem is that I still get marginal signal sitting only 2 feet away from the router and it still drops connection every half hour and I have to spend a lot of time getting it to work,signal
Sometimes it is slow to pick up the signal so I can not give it 4 stars but it is a good product that is easy to use,signal
Had trouble with the auto programming due to a WIFI network in my neighborhood over took the signal from my router,signal
"However, remember you wanted wireless, so don't complain about signal strength when you're 100 feet away from the router",signal
"Without this problem, this unit is very good with a big screen and fast capturing of satellite signal",signal
The first problem you might encounter is obtaining a signal,signal
"foot house, boosting a weak or low signal to excellent but you must have the Expander placed nearby your farthest laptop or work station for it to work",signal
All in all it was 58-59 minutes of screwing with the PC and 1 minute to verify that the Mac could find the signal,signal
"I live in a studio, and the strength signal bars (Mac computer)would go down considerably by just going to my back porch",signal
"When I replaced it with the dlink I could not get a signal in the far end of my house where the bedroom is, plus my iphone could not connect even on the deck! [replaced, get, is, connect] [far]
",signal
"I eventually got a signal, but the speed was actuallly slower",signal
"This router does not produce a reliable signal, once a day it has to be unplugged and plugged back in which never happened with my old router using the same ISP",signal
"I think the 614 is higher powered in terms of signal, but its software or electronics or both are faulty",signal
"I developed a scheme: each day, power down the unit and power it back up, to keep signal strong, etc",signal
I live in an all concrete house and my laptop upstairs has no problem getting the router downstairs and the signal is strong,signal
"The Netgear doesn't seem to punch through walls as well and the signal to the guest house on his property -- about 50 feet away, is much poorer than the Draytek",signal
"Then went to other side of apartment, where the old apple airport would still give 5 out of 5 signal strength",signal
Takes too long to locate a GPS signal,signal
So when the signal gave me 5 glorious hours up uninterrupted service I got cocky,signal
"I have not yet used the Linksys wireless notebook card, but the Microsoft wireless notebook card I have is giving ""low"" and ""poor"" signal strength readings 40 to 50 feet away indoors",signal
"I will try raising the router higher and later, if I have to, I'll get a Linksys signal booster, but I shouldn't be having these problems at such short ranges",signal
"The thing is, it needs to sit in a ""sweet spot"" between your router and the receiving device so the router signal isn't too weak, and neither is the extender's",signal
Before I even called customer support I had 2 blue lights and a full signal on my wireless comp but I couldnt access the internet,signal
"100BaseTx users can continue to use the net, but signal strenght on wireless connections drop from 68-84 down to 0! [continue, use, drop] [100BaseTx, wireless]
",signal
"No matter what channel I selected and after applying the latest firmware and recommended technical support troubleshooting, the signal strength was always ""very low"" and communication from the remote PC via the WUSB54G adapter was consistently intermittent",signal
"4, and the signal strength is full-on (at least that is consistent), so I don't see why I am not getting better performance",signal
Called technical support and was told that the signal could not go through the floor and a few walls,signal
Having moved to a bigger house I noticed my wireless signal weakened a bit so I decided to purchase the Liknsys Wireless Range Expander,signal
"After setting it up and talking to tech support for  2 hours, I still get the exact same signal (very low) as I did with the old g-class router",signal
I have a 1850 sq ft house and I wanted to be able to use the wifi in the back yard but didn't get much of a signal with this Linksys,signal
Belkin has slightly stronger signal and I've been very happy with it,signal
i bought this router hoping to get signal range improvement over my current belkin 54g router,signal
Only pro's would be that when it worked it sent out the wireless signal a lot farther then some of the linksys routers that I have used,signal
I wouldn't but another one the range sucks on it unless you plan on being in the same room or very close to it don't expect to get a good signal,signal
"If you're willing to spend the time to get it to work, it gives great signal! ['re, spend, get, work, gives] [willing, great]
",signal
"with only two bars of signal strength, but it just seems to me that the performance should be a little better",signal
I've used this product for about 5 months or so and was a bit disappointed with the signal strength of my computer connected to the adapter after the first hour of using it each time,signal
"When you first plug in the adapter to the network, its signal strength is described as ""excellent""",signal
"I would expect that the signal strength would not fade to minimal or none after viewing that description, but after short usage or minimal intereference (i",signal
"The average signal strength is now mostly ""very good"", every now and then rising to ""excellent"" or falling to ""good""",signal
The product is good as far as signal strength and range,signal
"I wanted extended range so my iPhone would get a stronger Wi-Fi signal in my basement, but it's really no different",signal
"The extender seems to TRY to boost weak signal, but garbage in is essentially garbage out, despite it saying 100%",signal
"I will routinely have full wireless signal strength, but the router will lose it's internet connection",signal
"This replaced a Netgear BEFW11S4 router, which was hideously inept at keeping its wireless signal up or doing port-forwarding",signal
"I'm inside my house trying to plan a route, I really don't want to go outside and drive around to acquire a signal",signal
"But when I moved the device to a more distant part of my network (once again with solid blue light on), the broadcast signal was no stronger than when the device was disconnected",signal
"<p>That said, my computers on two separate floors are enjoyning high signal strength and  shared internet connection",signal
"Worked just fine a distance of four feet computer next to unit), but unable to get any signal for other two computers that are upstairs",signal
"I purchased my router from bestbuy, and after a month of use, I kept getting disconnected from my wireless connection and the signal would decrease as soon as I connected",signal
"Strong signal, good interface, and streamed data perfectly",signal
"If your home is large or has thick walls, I wouldn't expect the signal to travel through every part of it, however",signal
My first complaint is that the router comes with the signal strength at a default of 50%,signal
Called technical support and was told that the signal could not go through the floor and a few walls,signal
Literally need to stand next to it to receive full signal strength,signal
The little light stayed red (instead of blue) indicating that it couldn't find an Internet address even though it was well within range of the signal,signal
"In most cases during my attempt at configuration, the Expander's signal was one ""bar"" less than the original Access Point in the basement",signal
"I have this router set up in my basement, and I receive the signal on the second floor my house",signal
"Currently, although I am happy (sadly enough) to say I can use the internet with this darn thing hooked up, I cannot get it to produce a wireless signal",signal
"I generally got around 75% signal strength with that unit, whereas the WNDR3700 did achieve a signal strength into the room around 95% (it just did not get along with the dlink adapter)",signal
The old MSN version with connected cellular signal produced a color coded road map that displayed (on 2D) all highway traffic conditions in the area of the map - over large areas if zoomed out and over more focused ares if you zoomed in,signal
The lifetime free traffic only works in larger cities (dependent on a relationship with a broadcast FM station to use a portion of their signal),signal
It works fine I have good signal strength where I need it,signal
", when WRE54G is on my network, it provides great signal in the room where it's installed, and it works at first, but after a time it fails to allow Windows to pull a valid IP address, resulting in no Internet access",signal
"I'm moving on to try the HGA7T instead - a fraction of the price of the WRE54G, much simpler solution that should be ""good enough"" and provide a stronger wireless signal that has better coverage than a single room (oh yeah, the WRE54G supposedly only boosts the signal significantly in the room in which it's installed, and the antenna should increase the signal broadly around the house)",signal
This is important if you want to replace the antenna with a larger one or attach a signal booster,signal
"Many of these signal-boosting products state that they are compatible with the WRT54G, but they are not always",signal
<p>The router signal strength is adequate but not impressive,signal
I had to try two wireless cards in my PC before getting a signal (but this may have been the fault of my first wireless card),signal
"I thought I would buy one for myself, but it didn't work the same way and it kept losing the satellite signal",signal
But dont expect to go a hundred yards into the public park and get a signal,signal
"Immediately saw increase in signal strength on all my computers with wireless adapters (desktop with linksys usb wireless adapter, dell laptop with intel wireless minicard, dell laptop with pcmcia wireless adapter)",signal
"I unplugged the range expander, and my internet speed rates increased back to my normal rates, albeit with a reduced signal strength",signal
"We (Cisco and I) eventually got it in sync with my wireless router but it only amplified the signal by approximately ten feet, if that",signal
I find it amazing that I was replace a 2Wire a/b/g router with one rated at n only to receive a poorer signal,signal
"With Linksys support on the phone, we figured out that the link was in fact increasing the signal percentage on other laptops in the house",signal
"The signal strength says 60%, but that does not seem sufficient",signal
"During the few times that I have used this GPS I found outthat sometimes it would not find the satellites at all, and you will only get a red (x) @ where the signal strength icon is, then you are stuck",signal
Nothing but a pain in my butt week signal and my computer is literally only 20 feet away they say thick wall affect it but I dont think they are that thick,signal
Like many of us I needed to expand my wireless signal to another building,signal
"The wireless signal was decent, but not a significant improvement  over my 802",signal
Another real plus was the range of the wireless signal on both G and N,signal
"If signal strength is better with the battery out or worse with the phone in use, do NOT buy an expander",signal
"Wireless clients show strong signal strength connecting to the box, and indeed the box's 'wireless lan link' light is lit",signal
"It does not give you stronger signal than any other unit! [does, give] [stronger, other]
",signal
It covers a two-story home with signal strength over 50% every corner,signal
"Overall, I am very happy with the way this router works, it has a strong signal and allows me to work at the levels I would expect from a wired connection",signal
8Ghz signal was 2 bars higher than the 5Ghz just one room away,signal
"The first one worked for a little over a year, and suddenly stopped broadcasting a wireless signal",signal
The signal is line of site with some ability to bounce into an adjacent room,signal
We've had this router for about 10 months and it's now sending very weak and intermitent signal,signal
I was hoping this product would raise my poor signal I had downstairs,signal
"And often I have the signal, but not the internet connection, and that's a problem of the router, because when installing again my old router, all these problems stops",signal
I bought this router and I would get signal only about 25% of the time no matter how close I was to the base,signal
Their customer service people had no idea what to do and told me other people's router were crowding my signal (I live in New York City),signal
"Not to mention that if highway traffic really IS bad enough that it should be avoided, by the time the FM signal gets picked up and the 1490t churns through the data, it's already too late",signal
"My Porsche is fast but faster than a gps signal, I don't think so",signal
"I owned this router for 9 months, works perfectly once I tried and error to different version of firmware and connection is speedy, steady and no drop signal",signal
"I tried to upgraded and downgrade a few firmware, nothing improve to the signal strength",signal
"How annoying when at the same time, my next door neighbor's Linksys router is sending a nice clear consistent signal",signal
"What's worse, it doesn't like someone trying to connect directly to the Expander itself; remember, it's nothing more than an access point at its core, so it should still be broadcasting a local signal which should do a private IP; it does, then shuts down and refuses connections",signal
"My environment is not electrically noisy, either - this thing just doesn't have the power to do anything but short line of sight transmission, and connections die while the status monitor still reports signal strength as ""very good""",signal
"Works pretty good until you or your neighbor get that microwave oven going, then signal's gone even if the router is within 10 feet from you",signal
"Works well, sometimes there are some issues with the signal probably because there are a lot of wireless router on the same building",signal
4 Ghz cordless phone or a microwave oven thats interferring with the router's signal,signal
********************************************* NETGEAR WPN824v2:  Has a standard signal strength,signal
"D-LINK DIR655:  Has adjustable signal strength (low, med, high)",signal
"I receive service downstairs, but the signal strength is on the low",signal
"Finally, I got it to worked and the signal strength on my laptop and iPhone downstairs were at full strength",signal
"pros: -large display -free traffic -good signal reception (locks to satellites fast) cons: -poor lane assist, often times shows way too early and disappears too quickly -traffic information takes too long to show up -sometimes suddenly changes to a different location and doesn't recognize where you are -menu navigation is bad",signal
"Oh, and by the way, the main reason I got this product was to see if it would have better range and signal strength than my Linksys WRT54GS",signal
"All the lights indicate it is still working fine, and my hard wire connection to the cable modem works great, but no signal emits from the wireless router",signal
The signal it does put out is so weak it's impossible to get a clean enough signal to enable 128bit encryption,signal
The wireless-G router can be on for so long before it stops sending signal or internet,signal
I left mine on all day everyday and found that it has a lot of problems sending signal and communicating with wireless cards (laptop and wireless computer),signal
"For some reason, they scratch out the serial number to signal that they won't support their refurbs",signal
"Linksys knows this and has corrected the same problem with early models of its wireless routers (I use one and the Mac sees and can use it, but with an extremely low signal, thus the need for an expander",signal
This model of the Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router disconnects the internet signal whenever the digital phone is in use,signal
"The bottom line was that using any other combination of computers, routers, adapters, and positioning of the devices resulted in our typical 1-2 bar signal strength with a positive internet connection",signal
Both the one at my home office and the one at our business office have done the same thing -- simply stopped being able to connect to the internet after a couple of months even though the signal strength was great -- and they only worked for a few days after the firmware download that the tech support people walk you through (or that you can do for yourself),signal
It has a strong signal and will dominate your devices,signal
"If it weren't for the excellent wireless signal stength that I now have throughout the home, I'd never give this more than lowest rating",signal
The laptop is usually just a few feet from the router so the signal strength is usually Excellent,signal
"I'm in a lab, with perfect Ethernet connections on both the WAN and LAN sides of this router (no ISP involved), and my wirelessly connected computer is sitting feet from the thing, so there's no ""bad signal"" issues",signal
"4 GHz channel and this band has only 3 non overlapping channels - 1,6, & 11; 5 GHz signal is reduced more when passing through walls etc",signal
But low range of 5 GHz signal through walls and physical obstacles limits the real world utility of this router,signal
"Unless you are going to use the 5 GHz signal within 15 feet, you do not really need it and can save money by buying single band regular 802",signal
It gives me the strongest signal and easier to config the router when compare to Belkin and SBC 1(gave that away so can't remember the brand),signal
"After some fiddling, it gave me 40% to 50% signal strength through my house's aluminum siding and out to the edge of my back yard",signal
"<p>You have to play with the two little antennas, however, to get the best signal strength",signal
)  <p>People who gripe about signal strength should remember that they are dealing with high radio frequencies,signal
"Just as your body moving around the room, as well as many other things, can interfere with FM radio signal, it can interfere with a home network wireless signal",signal
At first I placed it where old one was but I could get signal on my laptop in a bedroom,signal
"Set-up was very easy on the Netgear, but having to buy 2 units and both not working, I changed to the Linksys WRT54G and never have had a dropped signal yet",signal
"The extender now works, though the signal, while adequate, is not as strong as I had hoped",signal
"One problem I had was that during setup, because the wireless signal was cut off, my laptop, without my realizing it, connected to a neighbor's very weak unprotected signal",signal
The Garmin Nuvi 1450LMT is hands down the worst at holding a signal from the satellites,signal
The signal was also very strong and I was geting about 50 mbps downstairs in my townhouse,signal
"Finally, I was able to get the device to link to the router (both blue lights), but the device did nothing to improve signal coverage in my home",signal
Purchased router and additional antennas to extend range/signal,signal
DIR-655 work fine for us so far - no dropped connections and signal much stronger than the old one,signal
This router constantly drops the wireless signal,signal
Many times my laptop won't even detect a signal,signal
The wireless has worked flawlessly and the signal is MUCH stronger than from my previous router,signal
"<p>However, the wireless range and signal strength is downright pathetic",signal
Forget about trying to get a decent signal on another floor of your house,signal
"Not only I can't access the internet from my desktop, my laptop can't find any wireless signal! [access, find] [wireless]
",signal
GPS navigation is based on the triangulation of the time signal delays from satellites and the atomic clock in Boulder CO,signal
The main reason I bought this is because of the several wireless appliances I have I hoped to use the range extender and antenna to cut through some interference and provide a better signal to a desktop that sometimes drops when some wireless cameras are on,signal
"No need for a repeater; the main access point covers the entire house with a strong reliable signal, securely, with no dead spots",signal
"We live in a standard home with drywall interior walls with no insulation or other factors that would normally reduce the signal (large aquariums, bronze statues, etc",signal
"We have a back bedroom aboout 40' away, and while we do get a weak signal on laptops (1-2 bars) we get no reception on the X-Box, Playstation or Samsung internet equipped TV located there",signal
The signal strength is excellent but will go low for few seconds every 2-3 minutes causing you to logout and its really annoying,signal
As a side not: the device seems to work rather well if you install DD-WRT but the signal strength isn't nearly as good my old Airport even after using a configuration guide,signal
"It needs to be rebooted frequently, and the signal gets weak only 40 feet away",signal
Also our xbox only gets a strong signal once in a while,signal
"I bought this as an upgrade from my d-link DI-524 router, because I needed something more dependable for wireless, and something with a better signal (and performance)",signal
"This being my 4th or 5th Netgear router, I am familiar enough with their router management software to have attempted to tweak some settings (security, broadcast, and otherwise) to attempt to resolve the issue but was unable to successfully keep my router transmitting a wireless signal",signal
"2) While the 5 Ghz wireless signal is a nice option, of my 10+ wireless capable devices, only one is capable of finding and utilizing 5 Ghz",signal
"The range of the signal isnt better than the old Cisco G router its replacing, the other issue I had is the Usb port to which I connected an Epson printer, the software and usability its just rubish",signal
The main reason I purchased this router was to get better signal to another location  in my home than I was getting with my g router,signal
"8, my son's computers picked up 3 bars of 5 instead of 2 in wireless signal strength, I no longer needed the fan and all was well",signal
"The installation woes behind me, it does run good and the signal is strong enough for me to roam around the house and do what I have to do without being tied down to the computer chair",signal
wireless signal strength was just bit better than belkin &amp; was not any better than linksys befwf411s v4 nor wrt54g v1,signal
"From strictly getting a wireless signal from my router throughout my house, it did fine",signal
I will say this if they can fix those Issues I ll buy one in a second as the WIRELESS signal strength was truly amazing it has to be the strongest router i have ever seen when it comes to signal,signal
I can see if you only use the router to surf the internet that you would think this is the most amazing router because the signal can literally penetrate two houses away but even then it at times hampered my 8 Mbit connection,signal
1 of our laptops wasn't getting the wireless signal on the second floor of our house,signal
"I live in a two-story house and although I expected the signal strength to be somewhat degraded in the upstairs portion of the house, it was continually dropping the connection",signal
"The range and signal strength is fantastic, I had it up and running out of the box within 5 minutes, and I have yet to experience a dropped connection",signal
With either version my wireless laptop had a decent signal (3 to 5 bars) no matter where I went on my property (about 70 feet away max) even with 4 or 5 walls in the way,signal
"Some days I connect with good signal, other days I can't connect 5 feet away from the router",signal
"Sometimes I get a good signal, sometimes I don't",signal
"Remember, even with a 10% signal strength, you are still able to surf the net without a hitch",signal
"I don't get as strong a signal, but it is really easy to install - no hassle",signal
"7- Talking to my wife using the bluetooth, she couldn't hear me very well, eventhough i could heard her very loud Pros: 1-Big screen 2-Free traffic 3-Refreshing time is very fast 4-After the first time, it aquires satellite signal fairly fast 5-Speake is very loud Bottom line is not worth the price, you are better off with the Nuvi 265WT for 199",signal
"The Linksys card was worse--with the router ten feet away, I got a 30% signal",signal
"Pluses  large screen size   up-to-date points of interest   acquires satellites signal quickly   lane assist option Minuses  poor touch-screen response   can turn off entirely in the middle of a route! [acquires, assist, turn] [large, up-to-date, poor, touch-screen]

"Now that the unit is operational, I have a minimum of a ""Very Good"" signal throughout the house - so I'm happy - albeit exhausted",signal
Two blue lights came on and I received excellent signal everywhere in the house,signal
my older WGR614 Netgear router preformed for years at an excellent signal up to 30 feet from the router and I had to change back to using it,signal
The Netgear service tech tried and help we correct the signal issues with a firmware update and other tips,signal
"Once I got it setup properly, it still dropped connections often on the wireless link, even though my Linksys wireless card showed a strong and high quality signal",signal
"The signal is okay, and the setup is not so easy",signal
"4GHZ mode, at the same distance increased the signal but only to 54Mbps, which is the same as with my old D-Link router",signal
"Tech Support finger pointed to my computer (it's never their product) but I have three late model computers, two running Vista, and they all received the same signal strength",signal
"While it was working though, it output a very strong signal and was very fast",signal
"With average to adequate broadcast signal, you really should look somewhere else for a better router",signal
"This router has average signal, and HORRIBLE user interface",signal
"I recently moved my modem location to the far end of my home, and my old Linksys b/g router couldn't throw a signal to the other end of the house",signal
"My Airlink got much, much better signal & it was $30 something compared to $70 something for this",signal
When not close to a major urban area it can take over twenty minutes to acquire a satellite signal,signal
It was close enough to the router to rule out signal strength problems,signal
I'm purchasing my second Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station to increase the signal and cover all my property,signal
It will show full bars for signal strength and still no use,signal
I bought this router because i was not getting good signal from my old Linksys router and other sites said this router is one of the best online gaming routers,signal
"Most of the time the computer picked up the signal again, but sometimes I had to make it reconnect manually",signal
"*LANE ASSIST, JUNCTION VIEW, TRAFFIC UPDATES: Be aware that these features depend on what major city you are in and if they broadcast this on an FM signal",signal
Go on Garmin website to ensure your major city broadcasts the FM signal before you drop $50 or more for a subscription or an additional feature on a unit,signal
"I purchased this router from Costco, hoping to improve the range and signal over my 2 year old Netgear super G, which occasionally needs rebooting",signal
"Since you have to pay for the service anyway, look for other brand which might give you a better signal",signal
"i used orinioco for 1 week, and i had high signal in every room",signal
"I find the BEFW11S4 to be very strong on signal but, unfortunately, weak on features",signal
"By default, the Wireless signal is already transmitting, and DHCP is enabled to allow dynamic IP assignment to all computers",signal
"In order to activate the wireless connection, I have to unplug the router, only then will my laptop pick up the signal",signal
"Both work great and, regardless of upstair or basement, the signal keeps at 100% strength",signal
"I like to set up a work desk in my yard on good weather days, so signal strength is important",signal
"When going to other rooms in my home, 2-4 neighbors had higher signal than the D-Link 615",signal
"By contrast my cheap $20 router has signal strength for another 100' (but, the cheap one is becoming intermittent so need a more reliable one)",signal
"I get a signal in the front of the house (generally ""very good"" strength), which I didn't before",signal
Although I expected a stronger signal but is still decent,signal
The only way to get a good signal from it is to be less than 10ft away,signal
"Although this router sends out an excellent signal it is very difficult to keep password protected and after your warranty period help with this tedious process is very lacking! [sends, is, keep, protected, is, lacking] [excellent, difficult, tedious]

I didn't have any issues with the wireless connection as long as there was a signal,signal
"- I am on my laptop, 20 feet away from the router  with a clear line fo site and the config util says that I have a Tx of 250, a Rx of 3500, 66% link quality, and 60% signal strength",signal
"Otherwise, do not buy this router for anything other than basic wireless signal, which may stop functioning after a week",signal
"Performance of router was just OK - with the 3 movable antennas - I expected to get a much better signal than the Linksys router, which I did not",signal
"WEP, WPA) is enabled -Inconsistent connection strength - laptop kept roaming to AccessPoint b/c signal was stronger than range extender, despite being closer to the range extender -""Auto"" setup doesn't support WEP WPA (not well documented either) -At this price, setup, performance, and security support is very poor Strengths: -Solid, compact construction -Versatile power options (attach to wall plate or sit on surface) -Intuitive blue indicator light on box to show AccessPoint connectivity -Web-based admin tools (although somewhat lacking in functionality) -Looks great (only reason I gave it 2 stars)",signal
"With the new Linksys router literally right next to the Belkin router, the signal strength on the Linksys was much worse",signal
"Once up, I had great signal",signal
"When this happens, you have to go through some ridiculous ritual to try and get your signal back",signal
"Last time it happened, I connected the modem directly to my computer to make sure there was no problem with the ISP, and the signal was blazing fast",signal
The expander simply repeats the strongest signal when using the automatic configuration button,signal
"Well, better than no signal I guess",signal
"I tried multiple different things such as using only N or G signal, disabling QoS and even leaving the encryption off with no luck",signal
"With the expander turned on (and with my wireless signal indeed showing much stronger, as advertised), my download speed was down to less than 100 kpbs! [turned, showing, advertised, was] [wireless, much, stronger, less]

"Even though it was an older wireless G router, the signal strength was better than any of the new N routers I've tried, and my Skype video sessions were rock solid",signal
"I put my laptop a mere foot away from the router and was getting around 60% signal strength! [put, was, getting] [mere]

"Aside from the signal strength and reception, it seemed to be a solid replacement",signal
"For slightly less money, I got a better wireless signal with the TP-Link",signal
"- Setting up the router was more painful than I thought - Mixed n and g signal are less powerful than just g, but you can configure something neat here: set up a n and g signal with two different SSIDs, that maximizes performance - Does not do well with concrete (ie basement) or another wireless 2",signal
The signal strength can be dramatically different - Both speedtests and pingtests at various levels of the house seems to work decently,signal
"So I had a Windows borrowed from the office and it took me 2 evenings before, eventually, by trying on the different channels, the installation setup was able to find the signal",signal
I will say this: the router has an excellent wireless signal,signal
"I get stronger signal throughout my home, but with slower internet, it's not much of a bright spot",signal
Firefox shows I'm not connected to the internet despite the fact that my AirPort indicator shows me  as connected with full signal strength,signal
"Rumor had it, was even in the D-link manual, that the device could interfere with X-10 signal (home automation)",signal
I bought this router with a few simple expectations over my old D-Link 524 wireless G router: 1) Increased signal strength 2) Increased range 3) Freedom from microwave interference and 4) Faster Ethernet,signal
"The 5GHz band barely showed up in my office, which had a decent signal with my old router",signal
"4GHz signal showed up a bit better than the 5GHz signal did, but still not as good as my old one",signal
"On the positive side, the gigabit Ethernet was fast, and when I was able to connect to the 5GHz signal, I did not have interference from the microwave",signal
The signal strength is good,signal
"So if you can't tell what the wireless signal is, how can you tell where to put it? [tell, is, tell, put] [wireless]

You can't use your laptop's signal meter because that really doesn't tell you anything about the extender's actual signal,signal
"Sure, sometimes you can manage to get a wireless signal, but otherwise it'll suddenly drop for no reason, then refuse to let you reconnect",signal
The signal is strong and stable in both the 2,signal
"My notebook can only access the router via wifi if it is beside the router, even worse the signal is not strong",signal
"<p>Also:  satellites may sound cool, but unless you're up in the mountains somewhere, a cable or DSL will be faster (no delay waiting for a signal to bounce back from the satellite), cheaper, and easier to install",signal
The router sent an excellent wireless signal to the adapter in the next room,signal
The site survey shows an initially strong signal after a WAP reboot for about 2 seconds (great throughput then,signal
"If I take the laptop adjacent to the WAP, only then do I get sustained performance of 270 Mbps, but with noticeable signal level drops every minute or two, regularly, and nothing like the 200+ that others report at a reasonable distance",signal
"That is only 1 bar more than I can pick up on a neighbor's ""N' band router signal which is about 100 yards away",signal
"You can buy a WAP54G from Linksys for less money, get much better signal strength, and get the same functionality",signal
"So, now I have everything wired back up to my ATT DSL router (2Wire) where I do not have the regular loss of signal",signal
After an hour or 2 of attempting to get this to link my to my brother's weak wireless signal (100+ ft,signal
signal strength was 54 mbps most of the time,signal
My brand new computer gets a 1 or 2 out of 5 bar signal (about 5 to 30 Mbit/s) to this router when it is about 40 feet away,signal
"However, I can always get a 4 bar signal from my neighbors' routers on either side of me, and I know at least one of them also has a Linksys",signal
"For some positives, it acquires signal very quickly and the 5 inch display is clean and clear",signal
"If the signal does stay up for any length of time, it will be cut off by nearby cell phone, cordless phones, microwave ovens etc",signal
I'm hoping that technology has progressed to the point that I can count on a wireless router that continues putting out a signal for more than a day,signal
"<p>We use three wireless components at the house, and none of them could hold a signal once I installed the new firmware",signal
This does expand the range of the wireless signal but not as much as I would like,signal
"It's running great, with no Outlook problems, and better signal strength (45%), and I'm not looking back (except to write this review)",signal
"Well the GPS kept directing to get off the highway, (fastest route) and take a route which would have me going through city streets and hitting all the traffic signal etc",signal
"I was routed to a road which took me on an 18 mile trek through heavily congested business districts with many, many traffic signal and many, many trucks cars etc",signal
"Instead of the route my old Nuvii 250 always suggested, (also Google suggested) which was US 87 to NY 7 to US 787 the to I-90 the 1450LMT directed me to NY route 9 which is 6 minutes longer (per Google) and a route which took us through business and residential areas with numerous traffic signal etc",signal
I consider myself a little bit savvy with electronics so now I'm looking options on how to extend the signal,signal
"And strangely enough, the laptop with the g-wireless card has better signal strength than the laptop with the n-card",signal
"As for the laptop that IS receiving full signal, I wasn't actually too impressed when I walked around my house checking signal strength in the various rooms",signal
I had the cable guy out to make sure I was getting a strong signal to my cable modem,signal
"I called Gateway back to see if they could be of more help and was able to determine that the signal strength was only 7% from my husbands desk in the guestroom, to MY desk in the den",signal
"It is advertised to have a stronger signal than g, but it was not stronger than my g",signal
I am able to capture the signal throught my home,signal
"If your laptop is between the router and the expander you will have major problems, constant loss of connectivity, it freaks because there are two equal strength signal",signal
I had to keep moving the expander to the room I was in to get a strong enough signal for it to clearly be dominant and then manually choose which two sources of the same network to use,signal
I was a bit concerned about setting up a wireless network because of the number of rooms through which the signal would have to travel to get to where we like to use the laptop,signal
So far the Belkin is working just fine and the signal goes where I want it to,signal
When the unit was first installed I had 5 bars of signal everywhere in the apartment,signal
My neighboor's connection is more reliable and has better signal,signal
The expander does not give me a wireless signal across the length of my house which is only 120 feet,signal
My last Nuvi quit taking satellite signal after not quite a year,signal
"First, the Linksys signal was no great shakes, barely penetrating a wall or two and 30 feet",signal
"Second, my main laptop had a strong signal in my office from the Linksys but the laptop never actually accessed the internet wirelessly, even after putting in all the passwords, 15-digit security keys, re-running set up software, etc etc",signal
Pros : + easy install Cons : - Terrible Wi-fi speeds - Constant signal drops *This review was meant to be short and to the point,signal
"Turns out, the DGL-4300 has a 100% signal strength and consistent 54mbps whereas the DIR-655 from the same distance (about 50ft and two walls) only managed about 65% and 58mbps at best",signal
"My MSN Messenger would always disconnect, the wireless signal only a few meters away would be very poor one day, then great another, the port forwarding wouldn't work like it should, and then the router would completely disconnect from the internet about twice a day",signal
"I can take my laptop right now, put it three inches away from the antennas, and the signal would not get any better",signal
My best signal at about 25 feet only gives me about 11 MBS,signal
Hmmm boost the signal to make it easier for leaches,signal
"I'm ""green"" everywhere in my house with signal strength ranging from 90 to 100%",signal
"I have used this for years and have bought a 2nd one when the first one died BUT I can tell you it's a crap shoot to get the thing to work, It might or it might not, it almost always can be made to work as far as boosting an unsecured signal BUT if you are even vaguely concerned about security you have a night mare on your hands",signal
"I have to say that today it gets 4 stars because it's working flawlessly and the signal is stronger than ever (no clue on that one,  got 4-5 bars now instead of 3-4)",signal
Some people download third party firmware that circumvents the signal strength limiter but I wasn't about to do anything that might void the warranty and thus my ability to return it,signal
"100Base-T4 uses all eight wires in an Ethernet link, slowing the signal symbol rate down in order to make the signal reliable enough for Category 3 (voice phone grade) cable",signal
Had to continuously reboot router due to lost signal; Customer Support useless,signal
My computer gets confused between this signal and the direct signal from the router,signal
After installing the repeater which is suppose to boost the signal strength it turned out that it only got 10% better than my existing wireless signal,signal
"Like many others, bought this to reach the far end of my house where the signal from my WRT54GL is weak",signal
I get maybe an additional 10-15 feet with a usable signal,signal
"Was considering to add a signal booster, but would rather wait for a later model with stronger signal built in",signal
It need to be rebooted 3-4 times a day to send wifi signal,signal
I am well aware of the limitations of wirelss but this was truly disapponiting at 15 feet it was at 30% signal<p>But what caused me to return it the next day was the extremely poor attitude of the technical support at linksys they didnt even seem to care if it worked or not,signal
"11b router sends its signal, therefore my purchase was price-driven and review-driven (when the Netgear works, it works WELL)",signal
<p>The equipment has worked perfectly since I completed the installation and has fired a strong signal to my Airport Extreme card,signal
"After 1 1/2 hours on the phone with Linksys manually configuring it, still got no increase whatsoever in wireless signal range (I am not convinced it was ever configured correctly)",signal
Note- it is not immediately apparent that the extender is working except for the improved signal,signal
I literally just got mine setup in the far end of my house and have a full signal,signal
My signal was boosted from a miserly 11 mpbs (and that's on a good day) to anywhere from 24 - 54 mpbs,signal
I live in a small 3 bedroom but forget getting any signal outside the office,signal
I guess this may work out fine for anyone who uses the internet for no more than 15 minutes at a time or they don't mind unhooking all  and bebooting every few minutes,connection
bought the router 4+ months ago so my second computer could access the internet using Wireless connection,connection
however instead of trying to help me get the wired connection working they insisted again on only trying to connectiongo through getting the wireless connection working,connection
"Having just spent hundreds of dollars getting the wiring installed and having gone through the wireless issue for weeks on the phone 4+ months ago I had no interest in the wireless connection whatsoever! [Having, spent, getting, installed, having, gone, had] [wireless, wireless]
",connection
Even after numerous manual attempts I cannot get a connection,connection
Unit worked fine for conventional GPS function but would not hold the Bluetooth connection with my cell phone,connection
Problems seem to be in getting wireless-equipped notebooks talking to the hub - hard wired connection to the hub work fine,connection
"I had hoped that the LinkSys would offer me a simplified mannerof sharing my Cable connection on my LAN, and offer me more controland ease of configuration with server side applications I occasionallyhost",connection
00 new so I will say when I first got it it worked great until I reset it to because I forgot my password for my wireless connection,connection
"But, I really needed to install the software in order to turn off wireless feature (for security) and/or put in password so neighbors could not hi-jack my connection",connection
"1/ interface and they got my Internet connection to work, but they could not solve my wireless connectivity issues, even after several phone calls and talking to several support staff",connection
"My connection seemed okay, but the configuration manager said it was flaky",connection
It's just not worth having a connection that (,connection
"I also had a problem maintaining a cable internet connection in my 3-PC network, running Windows XP",connection
"<p>Fed up with Linksys, I went to CompUSA (sorry Amazon, but we needed our internet connection to work right away! [went, needed, work] [<p>, sorry]
",connection
"I kept getting ""Network Cable Unplugged"" messages from Win2k which fumbled around but almost always got a reconnection",connection
"In the mean time, I'll buy a different router like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connection)",connection
likely those who like it have a single connection or not using /n  in this case I advice them to save the money and go for a different router,connection
"The instructions for doing this were very very poor and for no reason the maps stopped loading a few times and while it did not take 8 hours, it did take 3 hours on a rather decent connection speed",connection
Here is what the features section says RE wireless speed: Faster Wireless Networking - The DIR-655 provides up to 300Mbps* wireless connection with other 802,connection
"But leaving my computer to turn on my internet connection is a little like going to the kitchen to turn on the bedroom light -- Just plain stupid, and definitely not worth the money",connection
But I really wanted a wireless connection I could use with my work laptop so I could use the VPN and connect to my office network,connection
"If you can stay within fifty feet or so, you'll get a pretty robust, stable connection and be quite content with this product",connection
"Like many others, the internet connection on my system was being dropped every 10 minutes",connection
"Before installing this, I had about a 10% signal at any given time, and it would take about 2 minutes to download 10 megs or so, which is REALLY slow given my cable connection",connection
"The sacrifice, however, is that any connection from this extended ranged will be slower than normal",connection
(Detail: I would get a wireless connection to the router but could not get DHCP addresses,connection
Version 4 will allow high-speed connection as will version 6 (to be released - according to the company),connection
It is OK if you have a direct cable/DSL connection and you don't have to wory about VPNs or web proxy servers settings in your browser,connection
"Range is acceptable-good, and the connection speed is perfectly acceptable",connection
"Both routers I tried were Version-B; however, even though the wireless connection showed 11mpbs, 100% signal strength (since I was only 3feet away), yet was very slow, about 2k transfer from the internet",connection
I got the same slow speed with a direct connection from the PC to the router (not wireless),connection
The setup was great and so far my connection has been solid,connection
Actiontec router supports only wifi g type connection but is very stable,connection
"For example, when the WRE54G detects a 54 Mbps connection with a WAP54G, WRT54G or WRT54GS, it will relay approximately half of the transmission rate to the wireless clients that are connected to it",connection
My last worked for about five months until I had to reset it every few hours to keep an internet connection,connection
It shouldn't have affected the plugged-in connection,connection
"In addition, if you have a DSL connection providing more than one static IP address, this router will let you expose only one of the IPs",connection
We have this router and 2 of the wireless usb connection too in my home,connection
"If you simply need to split a dsl or cable modem connection between several machines, it's the only game in town at this admission price",connection
Since you must setup the unit wirelessly (no ethernet connection is available) whatever wireless connection you are using to setup the unit must not be in range of any other wireless domain but your own,connection
"Whenever I tried to configure the unit using my wpc54g equiped laptop, my laptop would loose the original wireless connection to my network and connect to my neighbors wireless router instead of the wre54g",connection
"I have tried changing the network cables, switching between wired and wireless connection, etc etc, but none of them helps",connection
"The router works well for networking your comps and sharing an internet connection, but it fails at running online game servers, particularly Half-Life, which is what I primarily bought it for",connection
"Setup was easy, I got my internet connection up and running in about 5 minutes, and got all my wireless security settings up and running in another 15",connection
"Pretty basic stuff, checking connection, etc",connection
"Or at least, that is what I am imagining happened as it displayed ""we are now detecting your internet connection settings"" for several moments and then announced that I needed to enter static IP information",connection
Plenty of connection before you end up anywhere halfway productive,connection
<p>I purchased a router and a wireless USB access point so that I could connect my wife's laptop to the broadband internet connection we had set up,connection
"I then brought my wife's laptop into the room and set up the wireless connection, which seemed to work fine",connection
"11b usb enabled, which connection appears to be STRONG (4/5 bars); the router is located on the second floor, but not more than 40 feet away) - Though connection appears strong navigation is slow and lags",connection
"Defeating the purpose of having a wireless connection, (while leaving the other people without internet for the time I need to ftp files)",connection
"You'll find that if you placed the unit in a very cool place, it won't drop connection at all",connection
"This is completely unacceptable when you're doing things that require constant connectivity, for example ftp'ing a file home from work at the end of the day, playing games, talking to friends, or attempting to enjoy the bandwidth your lovely broadband connection is supposed to provide",connection
"The connection to the router would work fine with my laptop, but the router out to the DSL modem wouldn't communicate at all",connection
"I've upgraded the firmware, but that only established the connection until the next day when it failed again",connection
I have two wireless connection and a wired computer to this router and I would have to recommend not purchasing this router,connection
"Firstly, the router randomly stops allowing new connection, while existing connection remain up",connection
The reason for this crash is that Linux's connection tracking by default keeps track of old connection for five days,connection
"This five day limit quickly overwhelms the router when there are a high number of network connection, such as with BitTorrent, and can only be resolved by power cycling the router",connection
"The Buffalo has been ROCK SOLID for more than a week - no intervention, no power cycling, no lost connection, nothing",connection
"I reconfigured my old wired Linksys Router, which allowed the VPN connection, no problems, and did some research on the internet, decided to add a Wireless Access Point (linksys) to my existing wired router, again ordered from Amazon, should I need to return it",connection
"After 3 months of working satisfactorily, the router drops connection, both wireless and wired connection",connection
"I have made countless phone calls to tech support, spent hours trying to setup and reset up access and still have no connection to the internet",connection
"Last night, I spent an hour on the phone with a Linksys tech who got everything working great, but 10 minutes after the call, all of the configuration settings were gone and the router simply wouldnt hold a connection",connection
"I bought this unit to connect my Gateway Athlon desktop running Windows 98SE and my new company-issued Dell P4 laptop running W2K, and share a Roadrunner cable internet connection via a Toshiba cable modem",connection
"<p>To connect to my corporate e-mail, I must use a VPN connection to the corporate server, and then connect to the mail server with Microsoft Outlook 2000 via Microsoft exchange server",connection
"The cable internet connection was shared successfully between the two computers, and I could transfer files from one computer to another, share the printer, digital camera port, et al, without a hitch",connection
"<p>HOWEVER, I could not access my corporate e-mail account with the laptop, either using the wireless Linksys PC card or using a hard-wired connection with the Dell's built in 10/100 3com NIC card",connection
"I could complete a VPN connection, but when Outlook tried to open the program responded ""The Microsoft Exchange Server is unavailable""",connection
"Yet I could connect the laptop directly to the Toshiba cable modem, and access my corporate e-mail with either the ethernet port or a USB connection",connection
Let me first say the router is not stable in keeping the wireless connection,connection
If my wife unhooks the laptop and moves closer to the wireless router she still has a network connection,connection
No internet connection was possible when the router was installed,connection
i was unable to establish a connection after following all the onscreen instructions,connection
"another hour on the phone and two more technicians later, i was able to acquire a connection",connection
"Both DIR-655 routers in a small office had reliability issues:  both routers constantly did wireless restarts, breaking the existing wireless connection each time it restarted",connection
"Well those two things worked well -- this clearly has a terrific connection a couple of floors away (the Trendnet works, but with lower speed)",connection
"The connection was smooth, didn't drop all the time, and was much faster",connection
I have purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router which is capable of 4 hardwired connection to it as well as wireless connection,connection
The setup was painless and my connection (wired and wireless) are working,connection
"Many other reviewers here have said it, and they're all right: the wireless connection on this device randomly drops",connection
"wired connection worked fine(desktop PC) but the wireless didnt work at all! [wired, worked] [fine, wireless]
",connection
"How many connection checks does it require for my hard earned green cash to produce results that are CONSISTENT? [does, require, earned, produce, are] [many, hard, green]
",connection
"Spend the extra $ and go w/the Airport--I've spent days on the  phone w/linksys tech support, Mac support, and fussing for hours, and I still can't get a wireless connection from my laptop to the router",connection
"My old SMC Barricade Router only used Wep encryption, but had a solid wireless connection",connection
"The little thing has its good points - a nice, unobtrusive little box I can just plug in and hide on top of some piece of office furniture, allowing my rather over-laptop-equipped household some nice convenient net access, while still allowing the home office systems a wired connection",connection
It got to the point where I was constantly tweaking settings to get a more constant connection,connection
"It wasn't the adapter, but an internal connection",connection
"Yes, it is true that it was easy to set up at least to the point where I just needed to get the internet connection",connection
It took us a while to get it set up and the biggest problem we have is securing the connection,connection
"The bad one needs unplugged/replugged as it appears to lose power and all associated connection, wired/wireless",connection
"<p>A few weeks ago, however, the connection to the notebook card died",connection
"For the last 18 months, I have struggled keeping an internet connection active for more than two days straight",connection
"During that 30 minutes it works just great never drops connection, great connectivity",connection
I would not reccommend this router for anyone who uses a wireless connection a lot,connection
Worked fine then experienced extremely slow internet connection and constant rebuffering(quitting) with iTunes streams,connection
"I was then transferred to an incredibly incompetent ""technician"" who made me change wireless settings when I clearly told him that the connection between my computer and the router is actually wired",connection
I bought this router back in Feb or March 05 & put it to use with my mixed network of MACs & PCs and wired & wireless connection,connection
I use this router as an upstream router that connects to my ISP's DSL through a PPPoE connection,connection
I have never had this problem with any other wireless connection,connection
Set it up easy enough and had great connection with the wireless in the room it was set up in,connection
"Some times it loses the wireless connection, may be it is only my router and in this case I always make the reconnection",connection
"In the end, the settings are not terribly mysterious, but the troubleshooting primarily involves checking the control panels for both router and expander multiple times and cycling power on all units (including multiple PCs) in specific order multiple times until all connection are debugged",connection
router connection to computer and internet is easy,connection
"While that is not near the 11MBPS advertised maximum, it's still 4x faster than a good dial up connection",connection
) Hardwired nodes consistently have fast connection speeds,connection
The cordless Sony does not kill my connection as long as I do not have the base station near the router,connection
"Seemed very sensitive to placement relative wireless router: too far it couldn't connect or keep connection, too close it didn't offer much range expansion",connection
Since I cleared the obstructions I (and my family) have been thoroughly enjoying shared broad-band connection to the internet,connection
"With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connection to about 10 people with little or no problem",connection
"I took two afternoon in this 614v5, and went to staples once to exchange the router, which the unconnection let me think its defective",connection
"My old Linksys router never dropped the VPN connection, wired or wireless",connection
"The thing itself works fine, and is especially useful if you have ADSL (no need to ""login"" every time you want to establish a connection; it does it for you)",connection
"Also, it says *nothing* about MACs although of course the product works equally with MAC, IBM-clone or any other thing that has an Ethernet connection",connection
The only devices which had internet connection was the wired devices attached to the base station,connection
All repeaters and their wireless and wired devices had no internet/intranet connection,connection
The connection bars in windows was the same as the 2,connection
After much pain and suffering at the hands of this router not being able to stay running for more than 1/2 hour with two wireless connection (causes both wireless and wired side to freeze up) I managed to get a lot of good information on why this is the case,connection
"Yesterday, I noticed that the WLAN link light was off and my wireless connection were no longer working",connection
Utilizing the WGR614 with a wired connection works great,connection
However I got sporadic wireless connection (at best) even when sitting right on top of the antenna,connection
"Often times I couldn't connect with the router at all  and when I did, download speeds on my broadband connection were worse than a dial up connection",connection
"I have cordless phones, but they were not in the room or in operation when I was trying to setup my connection",connection
I know had a solid connection to the net because I could remove the Ethernet cable from the back of the Linksys' 4-port switch and connect to notebook and it was instantly available,connection
"After a couple of days, I have a strong signal in every part of the house (2 stories) and usually a 54 Mbps connection",connection
I then tried to set up the router with an new modem and a different ISP and it still only recognized a static connection,connection
"Yes, another brand may be more expensive but the consistant connection is far more important than price",connection
I did not have an active internet connection with the router connected b/c of the router which I had mentioned in my email for assistance,connection
However it was unstable and constantly required resetting (the wired connection) not the wireless,connection
"The first year or so, the router worked just fine for wired and wireless connection",connection
It works fine with wired connection,connection
"It either drops the wireless signal, or lock up network connection on wireless side",connection
But if you are looking for a device that is going to be able to bridge a connection and function as a wireless router you are looking in the wrong place,connection
I'm adding a MacBook wireless connection using Mac OS internal Airport,connection
"Next, Bellsouth DSL, which I have used for years and like for its remarkable uptime abilities, provides no documentation whatsoever about making a wireless connection to its router",connection
It claims to be able to detect your connection settings and facilitate set-up,connection
"Despite being up and running with a high-speed connection on a brand-new Sony, the software insisted that no connection was available and refused to let me proceed",connection
Pros -Great amount of features and customization -Awesome 1GBPS wired connection -Good price Cons -disappointing wireless speed,connection
Here's the short version:<p>Wired or wireless connection internal to the network work fine,connection
I had to install each update separately and try several times on each download for a connection that would last the duration of the download,connection
I have several computers and a HP Laserjet4 (13 years old and functions perfectly) I am hooked to my ISP's shared T1 with a wireless connection,connection
"The configuration page does not render properly on any of my three Macs, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless connection",connection
"So I went up checked the hard connection to the PC and still nothing, so I power cycled the router  and was up and running again",connection
"Other than not being able to maintain a network connection, this network router worked great",connection
It never drops the wired connection to which most of my computers are hooked up,connection
"All in all with its large screen, fast sat connection, free map updates the 1450 is a solid GPS",connection
"I'll have three hours of no problems, then suddenly for the next two hours, I'll randomly lose internet access on both my wireless and wired connection",connection
The d-link seems to be having problems with inderstanding ite passwork connection,connection
I couldn't move one room away from the router and maintain the wireless connection through a single wall at a distance of around 30 feet,connection
"5 hours on the phone, talking with three different technicians, they got my connection in sync and off I went",connection
Was excited to hook up a few pc's to share a dsl connection,connection
I had the WNR2000 and I wanted to upgrade to this POS hoping to get a better reception for my X Box wireless connection which I use for HD Streaming,connection
"This also includes some direct router connection, not just the wireless signal",connection
The connection speed was good at 40ft,connection
"pdf"" included with the device does not present the actual installation procedure (it diverges at Page 17, step 6) In the end, after configuring and rebooting, the WiFi accepted connection, but never assigned an IP to that connection",connection
Be aware it takes about a day to download the updated maps with a I meg a minute high speed connection,connection
My wireless signal disappears once in a while (even cannot find the router in wireless connection list),connection
I have not considered turning off encryption; if this is causing the router to become unstable then I would consider the wireless piece to be worthless because I don't want other people to use my internet connection,connection
Our connection speeds have doubled from what they had been on our fading hub,connection
"Most strkingly the connection I have is 20Mbps which I get directly only from modem or from this router only thru ethernet cable, while I go wireless, if falls significantly in its best positioned antena in a one 1 ft away to 4-5 Mbps which I feel is not worth of its price",connection
Short and sweet: This router's wireless G connection lasted a week then completely died,connection
"To be fair, I never tried contacting Customer Support to see if they'd ""fix"" the problem as I need a working connection right now because my son does home schooling",connection
"Following which the wire connection to a laptop on a docking station failed to work - the laptop on the docking station could 'see' the Router but not the network or internet, other wired computers were fine and turning the wireless on (and then off) on the docking station laptop resolved the problem",connection
"<p>To clear up any possible confusion, I should repeat what others have said: if you want to have multiple computers hooked up to your internet connection, this product will do that",connection
The defective unit I recieved ended up wasting a lot of my time and would have been near impossible to troubleshoot if I didn't have my old LAN only router there to verify my network and wan connection was still ok,connection
I have never had a problem with a wireless connection from this laptop its a very good wireless card,connection
I do not seem to experience any problems when connected via wired connection,connection
Only other thing is my brother claims he pushed the button on the top (if using the vertical mount) to try to fix the wireless connection (he obviously didnt know that was just for the quick connect feature),connection
"I bought this product based on the good reviews on AMAZON website and a prosumer router, but for me the router didn't work from the very begining, the wire lan is ok and internet connection, but the WIFI last 5 minutes and then didn't work again anymore",connection
The connection doesn't seem slow to me and I'm satisfied,connection
Also be sure you know how to reset your Internet connection,connection
The speeds were a tremendous upgrade over the B/G router I was using before and the connection is very reliable,connection
"2 weeks ago, the range for the wireless died and I am unable to get a wireless connection unless I am in the same room as the router",connection
"With Time Warner's recent push on low introductory rates and the fact that I was paying over $35 for dsl, I switched to cable internet with a faster connection and a lower price--at least for the first year",connection
"My old firewall stayed up for months (but I replaced it because it was a SonicWall and they wanted $300 to increase the number of active connection to greater than 10! [stayed, replaced, was, wanted, increase] [old, active, greater]
",connection
it gets alot stickier with persistent connection,connection
"It allow multiple PC's to share a connection, provides some measure of improved security, and effectively isolates the DSL PPPoe software so I don't have to install it on my and my wifes PC, and my notebook or reinstall when I upgrade, and gets the PC started because I do not have to log to PPPoe each time my computer turns on",connection
"I purchased one of these routers for my girlfriend, who just got a new Centrino-based notebook computer (a Dell Inspiron 600m), and needed to share an internet connection at home between her family's desktop Mac and the new portable",connection
"<p>It worked great for about half an hour, at which point it refused to talk to anything on the wireless connection or WAN",connection
"But, overall, the DLink has been good--fast connection for my Laptop, and now for the Iphone",connection
"even when it does get a strong connection, the dsl speed is often slower than a 56k modem",connection
tech support say I need another wired router (another $99) to make my connection work,connection
"The network is hard to config, I have to reboot many times to get a connection",connection
"When I was using DSL for my internet connection, I had to reset my connection at least 3 times a day",connection
"Now that I changed to cable internet, I still have to reset the connection at least twice a week",connection
"So anyway, here is my experience with the V5: When I first got it and installed it the connection seemed to be fine for a little while, but then it just suddenly went out",connection
"When the connection went, I had to go through a little ritual with the router and laptop to get it back: I unplugged the router, plugged it back in, pulled up ""Network connection,"" disabled and then enabled the ""Wireless Internet Connection",connection
"One evening not too long ago, I noticed that my connection had not been lost for over 5 hours of steady work",connection
Bought a Dynex for five dollars less that is as fast as direct connection,connection
"I though it would be best for them to set it up,via remote connection to my computer, so they offered to do so",connection
It worked for a short time wirelessly then stopped working even with a wired connection,connection
I didn't have time until some months later to contact Netgear to be informed that only they can set up the wireless connection but won't until I pay 99,connection
"Man, never thought a wired connection would be such a pain in the (&*%^*",connection
Next I tried to connect laptops by wireless connection to the router,connection
But if I wanted to run WEP or WPA (which is what I wanted) it wouldn't make a complete connection,connection
only a limited connection that wouldn't allow me to use the Internet on the laptops,connection
I had a bit of trouble in the first couple of weeks with finding the wireless connection after putting the computer to sleep and turning it back on,connection
First the likes: set up was pretty easy and connection to the laptops and wireless printers was easy,connection
The internet connection was usable but noticeably slower,connection
Almost no helpful documentation is included - make sure you already have an internet connection available so you can find help on how to get this working,connection
"Once I open too many simultaneous TCP connection, it'll crash--the lights blink as if it's still working, but it stops actually routing packets",connection
"If you use BitTorrent, RSS aggregators, or other software that opens lots of TCP connection, avoid this router",connection
I do not recommend the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router because the enclosed software was buggy and did not establish the correct settings for a secure wireless connection,connection
"The next day, when I turned on the modem, router, and laptop, we no longer had a wireless internet connection",connection
"Lately though, after having the router for less than a year, my cable (RR) connection started dropping",connection
"Although it improved my network connection speed to the internet (permitting the full 20MB/sec download speed), it severely crippled the ability to share printers on my network",connection
I told him that the best thing might be to reset to factory settings and just configure it to see if I could get a connection again and work forward from there,connection
I explained that I had plugged directly into the cable modem and reconnected my old router and had no connection issues that way,connection
"After hooking up our home wireless network using a Linksys WAP54G and appropriate cards, in combination with a Direcway DW6000 sattelite Internet connection (the recommended approcah by both parties) we anxiously awaited the range extender",connection
"The router will try and assess the network's connection speed, leaving the router to just be out for 5 minutes or so for a single disconnect",connection
The router would lose connection for 1 second and be down for 5 minutes and then do the same thing over and over all day long,connection
Cons: Won't keep any type of stable connection,connection
"Although the person was a little difficult to understand, they were polite, but then told me that I needed to get version 2 of this device, which, confusingly enough, has the same product ID number, but, as others have noted, includes a different image on the front with an ethernet connection",connection
"I would recommend reading a primer on wireless security before you fire up the wireless connection -- the settings aren't explained in a way that a normal person could understand them, and the instructions don't help much with that either",connection
My wrap board could go months without losing dropping the ADSL connection - very important for external mail clients with a dynamic IP address,connection
I tried most of the afternoon to get a successful connection to a technician,connection

This router will not maintain a wi-fi connection with that printer for longer than around 15 minutes after printing the last page,connection
"To restore the wi-fi connection with the router, you have to either power cycle the printer, or on the printer control panel switch it temporarily to wired LAN, then back to wireless",connection
"By the way, on my own I eventually found a way to keep the wi-fi connection to the printer stable, but don't know if it's a good long term solution",connection
"If you want your Canon Wi-Fi printer to maintain its connection to this Netgear router, you have to disable the router QoS feature called WMM (Wi-Fi multimedia) on the 2",connection

The location of the connection cord in the back is not in the most convenient place,connection
The connection to all PCs would hang and the router would have to be power-cycled to get back online,connection
The download rates however will not be affected on the computer which has the direct broadband router connection,connection
"Since I have installed the new router, my computer has not crashed, my internet connection is extremely fast and I have never lost a connection",connection
I would bring it down to my home office and reset the wireless connection,connection
"In addition, I tried to use this AP for *only* hard-wired connection (turning off all wireless devices at home), and over time (30 min or so) the hard-wired computer would lose its IP address over DHCP, and I couldn't get a new one",connection
"This seems to work well for cable based broadband connection, but not so well for DSL based connection where the PPPoE client is located on the DSL modem - which is the way most DSL modems are configured today",connection
Really wanted to keep this router but re-setting up the ATV wireless connection everyday was not very convenient,connection
the lan connection was fine,connection
It means that one of the supposed differentiator feature for this router doesn't work and you have terrible experience trying to backup things - it doesn't matter if through wireless or wired connection,connection
This required constant resetting of the router to regain the connection with the computers,connection

"On a wired connection with my linksys, speedtest",connection
net rated my home pc with a connection of up to 25mbps connection and wireless speeds around 15 mbps,connection
"I had read in other reviews that it dropped their internet connection every couple of days so at the first sign of this happening to me, I got an RMA and shipped it back",connection
When I had multiple computers (sometimes 4 clients) all aggressively pulling data down from visiting high bandwidth websites it seemed to handle the 16mbps internet connection ok,connection
"AND if you get a connection after an hour of experimenting, it's hard to keep the connection",connection
"As a concrete example of why this is important: With my previous Linksys router I allowed remote desktop connection to come in, but on a different port to reduce the chance of an attacker finding it and trying to break in",connection
"Well guess what, Netgear's one-year warranty (according to their tech service) does not cover connection to ""third party components"" like Interenet ready TVs",connection
"first person tells me after about 1 hour that they have to call me back because of bad phone connection (? [tells, have, call] [bad]

"Much to my surprise, the wired connection was about 10% slower with the Linksys unit installed",connection
You'll lose your wireless network connection as soon as these are effective,connection
I find it unbelievably sleazy & arrogant to hijack your customers' internet connection in this manner to sell them extra software,connection
"The plus side of the bluetooth is there has been a clear connection in the handful of calls made no one has complained of any static,  most callers think I am live on the phone and not going through bluetooth",connection
"And often I have the signal, but not the internet connection, and that's a problem of the router, because when installing again my old router, all these problems stops",connection
You are much better off using a wired connection,connection
"Fortunately, I have a wireless connection that allows me to access the web from my laptop while in different rooms of my house, but that's where the product benefits stop",connection
"I am no longer able to use the readyshare option (that stopped working after about a month) and I get constant error messages with regards to an internet connection, even though I am connected",connection
"I owned this router for 9 months, works perfectly once I tried and error to different version of firmware and connection is speedy, steady and no drop signal",connection
"What's worse, it doesn't like someone trying to connect directly to the Expander itself; remember, it's nothing more than an access point at its core, so it should still be broadcasting a local signal which should do a private IP; it does, then shuts down and refuses connection",connection
You'll long for the stability of a good old fashioned wire connection,connection
I was having to reboot the modem almost daily to maintain an internet connection,connection

The DIR-655 dropped WIRED connection at least once an hour and the wireless is off more than it is on,connection
You would expect any router to be able to permanently keep a wired connection up without any configuration,connection
"The Belkin also drops the wireless connection now and then, although not nearly as often",connection
The great news is that the Belkin has yet to drop a wired connection no matter how long I am on or how much I download,connection
"To be fair, the product worked fine without wireless security, but I see little point in helping my neighbors tap my internet connection",connection
"2 months into it and its dropping the internet connection on the wired ports, have to remove power to boot router to get momentary connection back so I could write this review and find a new reliable Netgear router to replace the DIG-655 F-Link/No-link router",connection
"It does have a fast connection and for basic internet only, its fine",connection
"Pros (they don't outweigh the cons, but here they are): Gigabit ethernet works well for the home network Range is great along with speeds Firmware has lots of great tweaks if you are technically inclined Looks slick Cons: Sporadically quits working with the internet connection (home network stays up), confirmed this is not an ISP or modem issue D-Link support (even the manual and website are incorrect at times) Must update firmware to get it to even work at an aggravatingly livable level To start off, I have had a horrible experience with this product",connection

"My only complaint about that dinosaur is that it suddenly looses the 5Ghz wireless connection when streaming a lot of video, probably because of overheating",connection
"Since I have implemented this, the router has not dropped the internet connection nearly as much as it used to (every 2 - 3 days)",connection
"The bottom line was that using any other combination of computers, routers, adapters, and positioning of the devices resulted in our typical 1-2 bar signal strength with a positive internet connection",connection
"With my current router, I have a connection which is on 95% of the time, and usually easy to restore by fiddling with antennas or restarting the router",connection
I had hoped that the new Netgear router would give me a 100% dependable connection,connection
"Instead, it gave me an unfixable zero percent connection for anything more than 30 feet away",connection
"Very occasionally, it refused to accept wireless connection (always worked for hard-wired) and the only solution was to unplug, wait 10 seconds and plug back in",connection

"To top it off, both wireless PCs again lost their internet connection and wouldn't connect again",connection
I researched the net and tried every tip I could find but was only able to get it to keep a connection for at most 30 mins,connection
The connection was excellent though when it did work,connection
What took me a loooooong time was getting the Wireless connection to work with my laptop's Cisco Series 350 PCMCIA Wireless LAN Adapter card,connection
"Once I found that out, I was able to set the channel, infrastructure and other parameters to make a wireless connection",connection
This router is known to have frequent issues with continous disconnects from the 100mb port connection,connection
Initially this fixed the dropped conncection every 5 minutes problem but it caused a delay in establishing the initial connection with the router of about 3 minutes,connection
"I'm glad I have a Garmin GPS, but would like to try other models to see if the unit behavior or satellite connection holds better than this model",connection
"But just like so many of the previous reviewers, after several months my wireless connection would drop frequently everyday requiring constant power unplug/replugs",connection

"Goes catatonic if you run Azureus (requires a reboot to get it to stop rejecting connection) and is noticeably sluggish loading Web pages even when working ""correctly",connection
DIR-655 work fine for us so far - no dropped connection and signal much stronger than the old one,connection

The signal was so weak that I could not turn on the encryption (could not get internet connection with encryption WEP,connection
WRT54G can't access to internet through wireless connection,connection
"Case in point, when I tried to set up SSH connection to two computers connected to the router at port 2000 and 2001 and forward the ports to 22 on two ip addresses, the router would complain that my end port number is smaller than start port and refuse to do so",connection
It randomly disconnects from the internet for all connection both wired and wireless,connection

Then the router started to connect with two wireless connection instead of one,connection
Sometimes disabling the wireless connection and reenabling it fixes the problem,connection
The time wasted trying to reestablish a lost connection makes this purchase more trouble than it's worth,connection
"I have Comcast as an ISP using a Motorola SB3100D cable modem, meaning the modem utilizes the cable for incoming transmission and a dialed Telco connection for outgoing transmission",connection

"The device will cut in half whatever bandwidth will detect, so the farer you position it from your access point the slower the connection will be when going through the expander",connection
"I had to play with the location to improve the internal reception, but even after moving the unit to an external area in a window facing the outbuilding, I receive only faint sporadic connection",connection
"I've been using this router for two days and already I've begun to notice delays in the pages it serves, both for wired and wireless connection",connection
"Pros: Works as described, increases wireless network range and speed Works with secured networks Compatible with Linksys routers Three year manufacturer's warranty Cons: Automatic setup doesn't work as promised (even on unsecured networks) Expander is prone to resetting or changing configuration settings if unplugged or power outage occurs Breaks frequently (in my experience), unit can heat up quite a bit during normal use Blue/Red status indicator lights do not always reflect actual expander status (ie 2 blue lights indicating connection, but connection is not present) Overall, when the products works, it works great",connection
The next day I noticed that my broadband connection to the web was very slow and I could not receive some e-mail,connection
"Never had so many problems with staying connected to internet (cable) ever and this was just my PC, the connection with the wireless notebook (when there was one) was painfully slow",connection

"This seems to be working, but the unit is taking well over half an hour to update, on a new computer with a high speed connection",connection
"the connection lights with the internet remain ok, but the router just freezes, stops working and then works again in a few minutes",connection
THE GOOD: The internet (via hard connection) works fine,connection
"After finally getting the firmware updated, I set up the wireless connection",connection
I googled this item and learned it has a history of drops and many sites discussed a fix of zero-ing out a default five-second setting to keep the connection alive,connection
"The only problem is,, that setting only works if your ISP requires you to login to your connection",connection
"I don't know about other ISPs or countries but in the US, neither Comcast nor AT&T require you to login to your broadband connection -- it's ""always on"" which is one of the benefits of broadband",connection
Both computers get a good wired static IP connection to the internet,connection
"Then, the cust service rep tells me it is always better to update over a direct connection",connection

"I've tried all the workarounds, from updating the firmware to using a secure connection - and nothing really helps",connection
"Somehow, as the connection goes through the cable modem to the router and then to my laptop's wireless card, the speed is reduced to dialup sometimes",connection
"Anyway, I finally gave up, only to find months later that there is indeed a problem with this router's firmware (related to DNS name resolution, which causes an intermittent but consistently occurring disconnection on the WAN port)",connection
Run the setup program several times until it agrees that you indeed have an Internet connection; 4,connection
"While the router was easy to setup and provides decent connection speeds when actually working, it periodically drops wifi connectivity on the 5ghz band for no apparent reason",connection

Slowly it moves from excellent connection to a hit/miss thing and recently has stopped working totally,connection
I can understand various things can go wrong with internet and wireless connection such as interferences etc,connection
"I bought this GPS for my wife who refuses to get a smartphone, and I can say it is inferior in almost every way to the Google Maps navigation on my android phone, save for the fact that the Nuvi doesn't require an internet connection",connection
"The setup was easy, the connection to both the wired and wireless PCs are consistently good",connection
"<p>I tried  resetting the modem, rebooting my computer, changing cables, fiddling with  addresses and various protocols on the network (dangerous territory for  me), and everything else I could think of, but the connection sometimes  worked, and sometimes it didn't",connection
"<p>It's still  taking me about 10-15 minutes of fiddling around with things to get a  working connection, so if the new firmware upgrade doesn't help, the router  is going back",connection

"The tv connection finally succeeded after an hour with a helpful Netgear tech rep, during which we had to use the 2",connection
Cold booted the router and then reconnected internet cable and re-booted all wireless connection and it worked (for another 48 hours then do it all over again),connection
"Worked ok for like 2 days, then the internet connection on the PC the router was connected to kept going up and down and then finally stopped all together",connection
"If you run anything that needs a constant connection (MIRC,online radio,web cams) this router isn't it",connection
"current modem is connected through ubs, however, the netgear router requires an ethernet connection",connection
"I pin-pointed a faulty internet connection function of the WNDR3700, even though the rest of it worked as expected",connection
"It will be working just fine one second and the next, I have full connection strength but no packets flowing through",connection

"0 os), because the connection was local access only",connection
I recommend D-link as their wireless repeater comes with a hardwire port for connection and setup,connection

My current WiFi connection that I'm using to look at the router doesn't even show up on the screen that shows all WiFi connection,connection
It generally works but the reliability of the connection depends on where you are located and where the expander is located -- sometimes frustrating and I found myself simply unplugging it sometimes when I needed a reliable connection,connection
"After using it for a day, I left the unit turned-on but idle for the weekend and by Monday morning it wouldn't recognize (serve DHCP to) wired or wireless connection",connection

"Also, the expander sometimes malfunctionsm, showing red access lights (ie supposedly no connection to access point) even when I could connect to it and actually reconfigure it",connection
"Unfortunately, no matter if it is a wireless or wired connection, the device seems to ""lock up"" and no network traffic goes thru",connection
"It is less expensive, relatively easy to set up (use an Ethernet connection) and works well as both an access point and a repeater (which is what the range expander is supposed to do)",connection
This router worked fine with my Road Runner connection in NYC,connection
"Also, the four port switch is useless as if I plug more than three connection in, the router locks up",connection
Every few minutes all connection/page loads would simply timeout for about a minute until the router woke itself up again,connection
The WNDR was ALMOST perfect except I was simply unable to get the WNDR3700 to passthru a VPN connection,connection
I configured it with a wired connection which was real easy then tested my wireless laptop,connection

"The wireless connection worked okay, but I could never get more than 35% signal (40 feet, 2 walls between)",connection
Con: - no firmware with WPA support to date - I am not able to achieve expected speeds downstream (upstream is fine) with a Broadcom 54G mini-PCI card - I am able to get full speed with the WG511 card in the other laptop Pro: - Range is great - Did not crash once on me - Wireless connection is 100% stable (I use VPN so that is fairly important for me),connection

Also if your considering upgrading from a G Network to an N Network i would say the difference is negligible unless you have a fast internet connection,connection
"After I was done, I didn't have any wireless connection from two computers",connection
"Setup is not for newbies, you'll only want to buy this if you're comfortable dealing with a hundred different settings for your network (which is of course how people want to spend their time :-) Problem is, the unit constantly drops connection and reboots itself",connection
I immediately got good connection with everything,connection
"Garmin's web site self help suggested downloading a software update but I could not get that to work, although a connection between the unit and my computer was successful, the file transfer failed",connection
"I purchased this for the main purpose of having the UPnP usb connection on the back, which is basically having NAS",connection
"You can speed it up by moving the expander closer to the router/AP, it will then expand the connection speed available from THAT new location but this then decreases your overall range",connection
The wireless connection could only be restored by rebooting the router,connection

Could not even get it to work with WIRED connection,connection
"After a year with the Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster (that created an immense amount of frustration and anger due to constant disconnection to the internet), I went ahead and purchased this router after doing my research",connection
"Most importantly, in my bedroom I always have a connection, whereas before with my Linksys router I was finding it less and less common to be connected there",connection
"11n wireless The slower speed of the *old* DSL router is not relevant since it only serves as a broadboand router for DSL, and you don't need a Gigabit connection to the Internet anyway",connection

"I'll need to set up a connection in another room in a few months so will deal with it then, hopefully in less time than I messed around with it this time",connection
"Next day, we bought a Netgear RP614 router, and after an initial call to tech support to work out an issue with the router talking to our kind of cable modem (a ""telco"" or 2 way modem, which needs a cable connection for the downstream, and a phone line dail-up connection to complete the upstream), we were up and running smoothly, and have had no more troubles with the network since then",connection

"If all you do is surf a largely static net, then this is as good a router as any & works both wired & wirelessly without problem",wireless
"Yes, I was connected finally and wireless now! [was, connected] [wireless]
",wireless
I can't wait until they work out the bugs and I can go wireless,wireless
"Maybe we are just demanding wireless users, but the DIR-655 crashes daily",wireless
I expected that newer wireless routers with the latest technology should show a big improvement,wireless
"As I began to write this, it had been almost six hours of attempts to set up our wireless network with no luck",wireless
"After following ALL the steps in the User Guide that comes with the router, I got on the phone with a guy from Tech Support, who ran me through most of the same steps in the User Guide (that's fine, that's part of his job), yet after 30 minutes or so with him on the phone, we still couldn't get my laptop and my desktop to be on the wireless network for more than a few seconds at a time",wireless
I purchase this item in search for a secure 108 mbs wireless system,wireless
I have a mix of wireless-g and b and both connected right away to the new router,wireless
I had no issues with DHCP on the wireless-b router that I replaced and found this very frustrating with the new router,wireless
Decided to upgrade to wireless when I found out that my old Netgear was not working correctly any more,wireless
"The wireless functionality worked great, but PCs wired to the router would lose connection",wireless
The problem got progressively worse to the point where I can only access the internet from my laptop which connects wirelessly,wireless
I purchased this to replace my wireless G,wireless
"My 35 dollars wireless router was just as good or better than this one, too bad I sold it to my friend",wireless
I bought the WRT54G wireless router to connect to my new Compaq Evo laptop with a Multiport 802,wireless
I couldn't get the wireless connection to work at all until I downloaded the firmware update of 1/29/03,wireless
After several calls and e-mails Linksys finally said that non-linksys wireless network devices have not yet been tested with the WRT54G,wireless
I consider myself somewhat sophisticated when it comes to setting up wireless routers,wireless
I have liked Linksys since my first networking kit back in 2000 and I thought setting this router with my DSL and other system with a wireless linksys adapter would be a breeze,wireless
"Either way, the wireless way was one of my favorite purchases in the last few years",wireless
For the time being(until I get a new wired router) I have my cable modem plugged into my wireless router and everything is working perfectly and I have my normal internet speeds back,wireless
"When my Netgear card worked fine on a different vendors wireless network, and a Cisco card I borrowed did not work with the Linksys router, the run around started",wireless
"Yesterday, I received my new Gateway 4500 with a built in wireless network card",wireless
"Apparently, Linksys routers are known to be tricky in configuring to a wireless network - Gateway even provided SPECIAL instructions for this particular router (they didn't work",wireless
Both my wireless card (also from Linksys) and the router were up an running in less than 15 minutes,wireless
"It was a piece of cake to get this set up for my mother with a Mac and a Windows 2000, both on wireless",wireless
"We managed to get wireless set up, but the connection was extremeley flaky -- it kept on dropping and we got page not found errors",wireless
"We eventually got the connection to be a bit more stable, but now we get periodic messages saying, ""One or more wireless networks is available",wireless
"or more to go to another page, wireless or connected",wireless
"Short videos would frequently stop playing after a few seconds or so and wouldn't go on no matter how long I waited, wireless or connected",wireless
The wireless portion of the router stopped working after only 10 months,wireless
"Range is not as strong as i expected, it did not work well in my home as the range did not improve much over the old wireless-G router i had",wireless
"It worked okay for wireless, but it wouldn't work at all for our VoIP phone which is the reason we purchased it, even though it was the model we needed for this purpose",wireless
We recently installed a Linksys wireless router WRT54G2,wireless
"I have set up many wireless networks, and never used a worse router",wireless
It turns out my Apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed,wireless
"The final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap, it's only a trial version -- you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional $40-60 to some unknown company to unlock all the features! [is, comes, make, sharing, 's, have, download, pay, unlock] [final, useful, additional, unknown]
",wireless
This should have been a pretty simple installation given that I have only one desktop computer and am not looking to go wireless,wireless
"Now unfortunatly Linksys is the most compatable wireless router out there, or so I have been told",wireless
We had the router set up with two wired desktop computers and one wireless laptop,wireless
"For some reason the router would only allow either both wired machines, or one wired one wireless, connect to the internet at any given time",wireless
I bought this router because I bought the wireless B Linksys 2 years ago and it worked great,wireless
Range: I live on the same floor as the router and I get wireless speeds of around 40-60 Mbps with WPA2 security set up,wireless
I do wish the wireless speed would be faster on the second floor but since I don't live up there it doesn't bother me that it's a bit slower,wireless
"But why are the download speeds a fraction of the speed of the wireless connections? [are, speeds] [wireless]
",wireless
This device works great if all you're going to do is hook up a few computers to it (both hardwire and wireless) to access the internet,wireless
I thought it would be nice to have a router with the wireless feature,wireless
"I already have a wireless set up running through my house using the Linksys BEFW11S4, and it worked just fine",wireless
"Without the standard being set for the ""g"", 3 of the 4 wireless ""b"" cards that I have did not work with this unit",wireless
My linksys wireless bridge (which connects my XBOX to the internet) did not work either,wireless
"<p>I suggest if you already have a wireless network set up, stick with it",wireless
Neither the wireless or the lan would work,wireless
"<p>The worst part about it is, I've probably only used the wireless function for a total of 2 hours",wireless
"Other times are even worse, I have to connect to my neighbor because my wireless won't even acknowledge me",wireless
"Another friend of mine had a similar experiences with this, went out and bought the most generic brand-X router, a motorola but I don't think he has wireless-G on it",wireless
"The only way I could establish and maintain a connection was to (1) leave broadcast SSID turned on, and (2) leave the wireless connection completely open and unencrypted -- and that was after performing a manual configuration",wireless
The wireless router keeps getting knocked off,wireless
I have had it for about two years and each time I have made a change to my wireless setup it takes me a couple of days to get the expander working again,wireless
Make sure you let XP configure thie wireless router,wireless
"Otherwise the disc that comes with the router will make it practically impossible to use your laptop to connect to any other router, wireless or no",wireless
"When I then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly, the internet connection was just fine",wireless
"Out of the box, this router did not work at all with my desktop comupter; it was broadcasting a wireless connection for my laptop, but my desktop's connection was completely dead",wireless
"The Network magic is also quite invasive, especially if you download the program for the wireless computers, which supposely can send a report on the internet history via email",wireless
I have a Linksys wireless WRE54H router and it still doesn't automatically configure even with its Linksys family,wireless
"it drops internet connection every 2 or 3 hours and the range of wireless is less than 14 feet! [drops, is] [wireless, less]
",wireless
"When the setup program failed to complete, it took my notebook wireless with it",wireless
"The first few months I had little trouble, the last month it has been dropping connections, had very slow connections, and my wireless card would not connect unless I reboot the router (yes, very convenient)",wireless
Now along comes the wireless version of this product - the BEFW11S4,wireless
"Should I buy the BEFW11s4 and get the functionality of my trusty BEFSR41 along with wireless or should I simply buy the Linksys WAP11 and plug it into my existing system? [buy, get, buy, plug, existing] [trusty, wireless]
",wireless
With the same enthusiasm I opened and installed the WPC11 wireless network card again carefully reading the quick install instructions for Windows 2000,wireless
Using the web configuration tool for the BEFW11S4 I wasn't able to change the wireless address number,wireless
"It was about one in the morning at this point and now I was roaming around the house, the yard, the garage with a wireless laptop",wireless
This is where things went down hill; VPN does not work either hardwired or wireless with this product,wireless
"After all, the wireless Internet access worked great",wireless
"Now I have the WAP11, the WPC11 wireless card and my trusty old BEFSR41 in service",wireless
"All of our laptops and other wireless devices worked very well with this router, improved speed, network coverage, video streaming, etc",wireless
wireless before you buy,wireless
"Instead of sending Ethernet cables all over the house, I also suggested purchasing a wireless router",wireless
Just read the Quick Install card to setup your computer's wireless adapater to gain access to the wireless connection,wireless
The wireless connection and ethernet can be used simultaneously,wireless
"<p>However, after 6 months of happily surfing the internet wirelessly anywhere in my house, the wireless signal suddenly died on me last week",wireless
i HIGHLY recommend you upgrade the firmware on the wireless router if you decide to get it,wireless
Linksys is going to replace my wireless router,wireless
11 firmware) Anyway here recently I finally got me a laptop with a wireless n card it in,wireless
Spent 2 hrs 20 mins on the phone w/their support group cause the notebook cannot access the internet when using the wireless adaptor,wireless
I have tried auto channel selection as well as manual selection of many wireless channels and nothing seems to work,wireless
I just know that wireless technology g or n is crap and plugged in still seems the way to go LAN,wireless
I had to return the first unit because it would fail pinging (via wireless connection) after twenty minutes,wireless
It is the wireless section of this device that has a bad design,wireless
11g wireless installed without any problems and nevry drops a connectio to my server,wireless
I have not had a great deal of success with this product as a wireless station,wireless
"It works wells as a router, but I puchased it specifically to operate as a wireless hub",wireless
"In order to activate the wireless connection, I have to unplug the router, only then will my laptop pick up the signal",wireless
"On the ads it says the cover range for indoor use can reach 300 feet, but the ones (wireless router and wireless PC card both from Linksys) I bought they just could go less than 10 feet",wireless
"After this incident, I bought a Lucent OriCONO wireless PC card and D-Link wireless router at similar price",wireless
I bought this product because I wanted an inexpensive wireless router that my roommate and I could use,wireless
After one year this router is dropping both wireless and wired connections at random times,wireless
"if you just want surf the web and enjoy your wireless internet, then get this router",wireless
"i couldn't connect to World of Warcraft through my wireless card connected to this router, or even if i plugged in the cat5 cable in the back of this router (wired connection",wireless
"This router is a piece of junk, and its not just the wireless function that is a joke--connecting directly to the ports via cat5 cable won't help either",wireless
"using the wireless or wired function from the router, I get 1/3 the bandwidth if it works at all",wireless
"It seems that if you have a PC already configured for a wireless network,and don't need the network adapter, you MAY have better success, but, I wouldn't count on it! [seems, have, configured, do, need, have, count] [wireless, better]
",wireless
But I can get on to my neighbors unprotected Netgear wireless router,wireless
The first thing this unit does when you plug it in is turn off your wireless security,wireless
"First, I bought it and a netgear wireless card for my laptop and a netgear wireless card for my second desktop",wireless
Cons: The signal strength was the poorest of any wireless router I've ever used,wireless
"I've had this problem with my Dell 1300 wireless card in my laptop, belkin USB wireless adapter and others",wireless
"Maybe some other wireless cards may work flawless, but I had very little success with linksys using encryption",wireless
"She then plugged the router back in, and, all of a sudden it's wireless range cratered and has since not returned",wireless
We have no problem using the router to connect to the internet wirelessly so long as we're in the same room as the router,wireless
"Since I did not have a phone jack in my spare bedroom/office and could not get anyone to install one, I was advised to get a wireless router",wireless
Couldn't detect the network at all even though I could find other wireless networks in the area,wireless
The front panel has lights that recognize wireless and which LAN lines are being used,wireless
"Though I don't use my wireless NETGEAR WGR614 very often, it was broken soon after a year, and it now generates very high pitched sharp sound which is so annoying",wireless
All reviews for wireless products seem to run the gamut from great to terrible,wireless
The router I got was defective - the wired part working and the wireless does not,wireless
I bought this router and a Linksys wireless card 1-1/2 years ago,wireless
"The wireless card lasted until a month ago and I replaced it with a Belkin card with a ""lifetime"" warranty",wireless
I bought this wireless-B broadband router about 2 years ago,wireless
It was price convenient and provided a pcmcia wireless ethernet card,wireless
"Initially I thought it was just the wireless, so I focused on that",wireless
Today I can tell that this problem is mainly on the wireless but still you have problems with the wired connections,wireless
I have set up 3 different wireless networks for my apartments over the past 3+ years,wireless
"First off, the really tough thing about wireless routers is that your performance can vary dramatically from someone elses",wireless
2 ) Anytime a cordless phone is used in the house it knocks out my wireless connection,wireless
"Unfortunately, I am not sure there are any good alternatives out there and I'm not prepared to spend the time and money experimenting with the few other products that claim to expand wireless network ranges securely",wireless
I have been using the Linksys wireless router and access card for about three months,wireless
", sometimes does not connect even when it recognizes an available wireless network)",wireless
;-) Simply couldn't get my wireless network (all Linksys equipment) and this thing to talk to each other,wireless
Look around when your are traveling and see which wireless routers are unprotected,wireless
I finally got around to purchasing this wireless router to go with it,wireless
I have been using the non-wireless 614 router with no problems and figured moving to the wireless version of the same product would be a piece of cake,wireless
"I would say that, very reliably, my wireless iMac can detect the presence of the router",wireless
"Once I enabled the AirPort card in the iMac, I was able to detect other wireless transceivers in the building and surf the net on their ISP's",wireless
"I mean, it is capable of working, but my neighbors' wireless routers have been more reliable than the one I bought for myself",wireless
I bought it for the wireless feature,wireless
"Anyway, after that, all worked exactly like i expected it to _ I hada bedroom in my house that was completely dead to my wireless network, but now, I have ""Excellent"" connectivity",wireless
"The wireless portion only works if there is not security protection used, which is the purpose for which we bought this router! [works, is, used, is, bought] [wireless]
",wireless
"The 655 was chosen for it's decent reviews, gigabit ports, and wireless functionality",wireless
I spent more time organizing the cables then setting up the router (along with wireless clients),wireless
"Its performance is decent (transfered some files today from wired->wireless) but wireless will never beat cable in latency, transfer rates, or stability, its just not possible (at least for consumers and this price) so don't expect it to",wireless
Connecting to other wireless N routers (including other Dlink 655s) achieve a full 300mbs connection to my laptop,wireless
The only downside is that sometimes you need to restart it each month otherwise the wireless becomes unstable,wireless
I've had the Netgear wireless router for a three months and it has been nothing but a problem,wireless
I've checked my laptop and the wireless capability works great,wireless
"I bought this along with the DWA-140 wireless adapter and had high hopes for a long range, fast network",wireless
"Once I did get it set up, I am able to connect to the internet wireless with another laptop; which is why I bought it in the first place",wireless
I have also found the expander to be more susceptible to interference from other wireless devices than the WRT54G,wireless
"why they just couldn't put all the wireless settings under ""wireless"" and all the ""port"" settings under port, i don't know",wireless
"I purchased this router to upgrade my network from a 10/100 Ethernet, b/g wireless to 1Gbs Ethernet, b/g/n capabilities",wireless
"For wireless we started with one of the WinXP machines and they recommended WEP encryption due to ""issues"" with WPA2 on WinXP",wireless
"Also, the previous router used WEP wireless security",wireless
The first tech was unable to get the WinXP system to connect to the wireless network and turfed the issue to Dell stating that they did not support Dell software,wireless
"Still, this wireless adapter software had no provisions for WEP (only WPA2), so the agent attempted to get Windows to manage the card, with no success",wireless
Back to Dell support to reload wireless card drivers in the first XP laptop,wireless
"So far, no apparent improvement in wireless network speed, but wired Gigabit is nice",wireless
"Not only did it not transmit a wireless signal, it didn't route! [did, transmit, did] [wireless]
",wireless
":'(  This makes wireless limited, especially when adding a little security by controlling who gets what IP address",wireless
"For wireless, I couldn't find ways to secure this other than through the limited and crackable WEP feature, which doesn't work BTW for some Wi-Fi cards",wireless
"The password sent over the wire is insecure in clear-text, but should be safe for non-wireless users",wireless
"So, it's under warranty and they offer a great exchange policy (I know, because I had to use it with their wireless router at work -- it too just died one day), so I will exchange it for another one",wireless
"I got one computer to work, but my other wireless devices, couldn't connect",wireless
"I brought a new Links wireless WRT160N from Walmart; sorry Amazon, router and have been trying to get it to work for the last 2 days; but it wouldn't connect, whatever I did",wireless
"I don't know what it is about Safari, but Linksys wireless router, definitely do not like it",wireless
"I knew better than to get an ""all-in-one"" wireless gateway and router, but my Netgear has been acting up and I thought it might be time to get a new router, one that was highly recommended from an industry leader and could stand up to regular abuse in an area with strong wifi pollution",wireless
"After using it for a day, I left the unit turned-on but idle for the weekend and by Monday morning it wouldn't recognize (serve DHCP to) wired or wireless connections",wireless
"Overnight, between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, it decided to stop routing traffic to any wired or wireless connections although it was still handing out IP addresses",wireless
"Regretfully, I have to return this to Amazon and will have to look to other solutions to provide both wired and wireless Internet access in my home",wireless
"Worked great, but now in june the wireless craped out",wireless
I have tried two wireless routers to date with my IBM Thinkpad w/ Centrino wireless,wireless
"Linksys technical support even tried to dump me off to IBM technical support, but I just didn't buy it, considering my wireless connections have been fine elsewhere",wireless
"I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that, tweaking the connection software, upgrading firmware, blah blah blah, but honestly, how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running",wireless
"I've been using this as my wireless router for much too long, and I'm on Amazon now to find a replacement",wireless
I'm hoping that technology has progressed to the point that I can count on a wireless router that continues putting out a signal for more than a day,wireless
"Now that I finally have it working, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my power doesn't go out and all of my wireless devices have to reconnect to it! [have, working, 'm, keeping, crossed, does, go, have, reconnect] [wireless]
",wireless
"The only upside is that the WRE54G appears, by inspection, to at least be extending my wireless network's range into areas of my house that had very weak signal strength previously",wireless
"Purchased what seemed like a good wireless router, but eventually the performance dropped, pages timed-out etc",wireless
"I had wireless internet and everything working correctly, but the setup did not recognize this and would not let me move on to continue in the setup",wireless
"Once I got it hooked up, it worked pretty good, with the wireless internet and everything else",wireless
This product doesn't come with a wireless on/off switch so even when I connected both of the computer by cable the wireless is still on,wireless
"When used in the wireless security mode, you will OFTEN get disconnected by the router",wireless
"So, unless you want an unsecured wireless network, do not buy this",wireless
"So I have a wireless router that does not talk to my wireless device--it just sits between the DSL modem and my desktop, taking up space",wireless
"This results in you having to reset the router and since its wireless, there's a pretty good chance you're not in the same room as the router",wireless
"Unfortunately, no matter if it is a wireless or wired connection, the device seems to ""lock up"" and no network traffic goes thru",wireless
I'm going out today to buy a new NetGear wireless router,wireless
"According a website that monitors network equipment evaluations, 14 of 16 lab reports gave it their highest rating for wireless routers",wireless
"Installing the router was a piece of cake, but connecting the PC thru wireless was a little more complicated",wireless
"The wireless card could detect the network, but could not connect to it",wireless
We eventually got it to connect wireless to the network and it seems to be working great right now,wireless
Just be prepared to spend some time on the phone with Linksys support if you buy this product because I don't think that it is quite as simple as plug and play if you intend to go wireless,wireless
"Also, I have purchased their wireless access point and associated card for my laptop, and while the access point works fine, the card is junk",wireless
I went out and bought a Lucent Orinoco wireless card (which was about 3x as expensive) and it works great,wireless
Bought a Linksys wireless card for my dad's PC and it didn't work EITHER,wireless
(We were not utilizing the wireless side - we're all CAT 5 hard wired),wireless
"Wired performance is fine, same with wireless, though I didn't exhaustively test either of these",wireless
I also purchashed the wireless pci  card and spent a total of 155,wireless
"<p>We use three wireless components at the house, and none of them could hold a signal once I installed the new firmware",wireless
"It was so bad, I thought it was something that had to do with my wireless cards",wireless
This does expand the range of the wireless signal but not as much as I would like,wireless
I configured it with a wired connection which was real easy then tested my wireless laptop,wireless
The wired method works but I need wireless,wireless
This is the worst wireless router I have ever seen,wireless
I have set up wireless routers since their inception from all almost all manufacturers and I have had the most issues with Linksys,wireless
"The wireless connection worked okay, but I could never get more than 35% signal (40 feet, 2 walls between)",wireless
This one is not wireless like I had thought it was,wireless
"Once I updated the firmware the wireless speed DOUBLED! [updated, DOUBLED] [wireless]
",wireless
The schedule settings for the wireless are really lame,wireless
"I'm a big fan of Linksys, I have used many of their routers for my customers, so when it was time for me to switch to wireless I naturally bought the BEFW11S4",wireless
"I'll stick with Linksys for their wired routers, but time to try someone else for wireless",wireless
"Although I still have never been able to configure this item, it actually appears to function based on tests performed around my house with various wireless devices",wireless
"Although I was pleased with the Ethernet 1Gbit connectivity, and the direct close wireless access 802n connectivity with my MacBook pro, that was a totally different ball game when crossing 2 walls",wireless
"It was running in a couple minutes, and very easy to wirelessly share my printer",wireless
"Channel number for the linksys wireless card (also version 4) was not configurable, if it was different from the default channel 6",wireless
"<p>Since I was very happy using Linksys's WIRED 4-port router before, I was willing to spend more bucks to buy a wireless router from linksys again, which turned out not to be as good",wireless
I bought this wireless router to extend the WiFi service to the edge of my property (1/2 Acre,wireless
"The desktop works fine as it's not wireless,  but I have been having issues with my signal dropping on the laptops, and another issue with weak signal strength",wireless
"And strangely enough, the laptop with the g-wireless card has better signal strength than the laptop with the n-card",wireless
"Another strange thing is, apparently the router comes with several default settings that aren't ideal for connecting wirelessly, which seems stupid",wireless
"I've set up quite a few wireless networks without many problems, but these are settings I have no clue what they mean and would never think to change them (or even know how)",wireless
I will once I get my wireless laptop from work,wireless
I had used wireless before with Webgear but thought a wireless router would be a good upgrade,wireless
What they have basically done is taken a piece of metal and shoved some wires in it and have claimed it can give one wireless internet,wireless
"After I was done, I didn't have any wireless connections from two computers",wireless
"The DIR-655's hardware is great, strong wireless coverage throughout my 1750 sq ft flat and great speed",wireless
"Really poor performance by D-Link, why are there NO good wireless router providers? [are] [poor, good, wireless]
",wireless
First the router needed to be reset every morning for the three days I used it because the wireless quit broadcasting the network,wireless
Tech examined it and said it was defective for wireless use,wireless
"Either way, if you don't want headaches from your wireless router, my recommendation is you buy from a different brand",wireless
I now have a D-Link wireless N router that has been problem free for more than 18 month now,wireless
I have spent several futile hours trying to get the wireless working with my Wife's Compaq Wireless card,wireless
I have owned and installed this wireless router and have found it unsuitable for noisy and busy cable modem environments,wireless
"The router (wired and wireless) just cannot handle the simultaneous use of two computers on a wired network, a couple of laptops in a noisy wireless environment, and the automated hacker attempts coming in from the cable modem",wireless
"I had two pcs (wired) & an Xbox, (wireless)",wireless
Purchased this router but could never get it working in wireless mode with my laptop,wireless
"My laptop is frequently used on other wireless networks without a problem, and the DIR-655 replaced an older, cheaper Belkin which worked",wireless
My wireless settings: WEP Channel 1 SSID enable N and G mode only Firmware 1,wireless
I wanted to use my old router as a dedicated wireless G access point and this one for 802,wireless
I would rate the router as 3 stars but I took off an extra star for the price because I consider this to be a pretty standard wireless N router,wireless
I replaced the DIR-655 with a TP-Link 300 Mb/s wireless N router,wireless
11b wireless networks but in actual fact it does not,wireless
I called tech support and asked why my unit was not working and they said that they had made a mistake because the unit will not work with a wireless B network,wireless
"The logs don't work, and when I check to see what is connected to the wireless it always shows nothing",wireless
I can't see my wireless printer anymore,wireless
Router worked adequately during the first 5 months - I was disappointed that the wireless signal was no better than an old Belkin G router - that was the primary reason for my upgrade,wireless
"As with nearly all of the wireless products out there (especially Linksys), this was a pain to set up",wireless
I bought this router to extend the range of the wireless network within my house,wireless
The wireless connection could only be restored by rebooting the router,wireless
"Much to my surprise, the device will not work with any non-linksys wireless NIC's",wireless
"level: career techie (not IT guy) equipment: (old) Netgear 108Mbps router, (antique) Linksys 10/100 wired router Problem: Failing G router (weekly reboots), no wireless on antique router, Desire for Gigabit and N router in a mixed network",wireless
"The setup was easy and router, dhcp, firewall, wireless and ethernet were all fine on the weekend",wireless
Now we use the office befw11s4 as a wireless access point only,wireless
"If I turned off my wireless, had to restart the netgear to issue new DHCP addresses, wack",wireless
I accidentally bought a WGR614v9 today as a replacement for a broken wireless router and tried to configure it,wireless
When I left college and moved to a new apartment I picked this up for my new home wireless network,wireless
"There should have been no problems, but we did have 12 wireless devices running on it",wireless
"That's why we got it, so it would handle our heavy wireless use",wireless
"I originally bought this router in 2003 with plans to set up a wireless network in my home where three computers were operating on 3 different connections - two unique broadband links (Cable, DSL) and one on a 56K modem",wireless
"If that is the case, I will be scouring the market for a worthwhile wireless router and not this overhyped, overcomplicated, poorly functioning and mass-marketed piece of plastic that I've been using",wireless
WDS mode basically allows the wireless network to be expanded (i,wireless
"With a growing stable of wireless and wired devices (Desktop PCs, laptops, Mobile phones, iPads, PS3, BluRay players",wireless
") I figured it was time to upgrade to a wireless router that would support both G and N, and also includes Gigabit wired switch",wireless
Helped a lot with the wired connections (Have a NAS drive with photos and Videos)   -- Didn't test the throughput of the wireless bands but didn't see anything slow down when they were working  THE BAD   -- The data monitor built into the device is pretty useless,wireless

If you live in an apartment - get a router that has a Dual Band feature and only run your wireless off of the 5 ghz band,wireless
After installing the repeater which is suppose to boost the signal strength it turned out that it only got 10% better than my existing wireless signal,wireless
So I still have to connect to the original wireless network that I am trying to fix w/ this repeater,wireless

I purchased the Netgear WGR614 mainly because of its ability to limit access to the wireless network via a MAC address along with using Wep encryption,wireless
"My old SMC Barricade Router only used Wep encryption, but had a solid wireless connection",wireless
"But until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem, I can't possibly justify giving the BEFW11S4 more then two stars",wireless
When I get my newer laptops online they are very fast for a wireless network system,wireless
"My older Microsoft ""G"" wireless router never dropped out",wireless
"On my old d-link router I had excellent speed (wired desktop, wireless desktop and 5 laptops), but only one of the ports in the back worked - whenever I'd want to swap to xbox or bluray dvd (neither of which I had the wireless option for) I'd have to swap out the cables",wireless
"I would stay connected via wireless however it would randomly say "" No Internet Connection """,wireless
It became worse each day until I was literally sitting right next to the router and only showing two wireless bars on my laptop ( which is a brand new MacBookPro by the way ),wireless
"But the DIR-655 did not work as well and now only the wired ports work, the wireless will not work longer than 60 seconds or so before it fails again",wireless
"The bad one needs unplugged/replugged as it appears to lose power and all associated connections, wired/wireless",wireless
I thought to myself that it was the notebook card and I needed a new system anyway so I purchased a desktop with an internal (MSoft) wireless adapter,wireless
"When I plugged in the power , after 10 seconds the router would lose the WLAN mac address and then no wireless clients could connect anymore",wireless
"I had been using a Dell wireless router for nearly six months, but when we began having some connection speed problems, Dell said it NEVER should have worked with Charter Pipeline (my cable provider)",wireless
They recommended I buy the Linksys wireless router,wireless

"128bit WEP works well with my multiple devices, a wireless-g laptop and a 802",wireless
Managed all on my own and here's what I learned and wished I had done: --REVIEW your laptop's wireless network features from the Windows + Dell Help & Support menus + system info before installing a router,wireless
I would not reccommend this router for anyone who uses a wireless connection a lot,wireless
But that's only part of why you buy a wireless router,wireless
"We decided to share our DSL line, and the IT guys at work suggested that Linsys had a good reputation, so we ordered their wireless router and a USB wireless adapter",wireless
We then bought the Microsoft wireless rrouter and it installed without a hitch,wireless
"I was then transferred to an incredibly incompetent ""technician"" who made me change wireless settings when I clearly told him that the connection between my computer and the router is actually wired",wireless
"Whatever you do don't try to use a PC and an Apple on the same wireless network, they don't have the software to cover that",wireless
We ended up going with a Westell wireless router and have had no problems (straight from the box),wireless
"However, I run two wireless laptops and both have frequent issues with disconnections",wireless
I have to continuously reset this router so that my wired devices will be recognized by my wireless laptop,wireless
My $40 NetGear wireless router never had a problem; this thing is grossly overpriced for the quality & reliability,wireless
Then the wireless networking worked but the wired networking failed,wireless
It drops my connection on a daily basis and even minor changes to the wireless settings must be done after reverting to factory default,wireless
I bought this router back in Feb or March 05 & put it to use with my mixed network of MACs & PCs and wired & wireless connections,wireless
I finally disconnected it & used one of my wireless routers down stream to do the job,wireless
I have never had this problem with any other wireless connection,wireless
<p>I'll be returning this and moving on to the next wireless router (we already tried and returned a D-Link DI-614+),wireless
I am able to surf the web or do normal day to day wireless activities pretty much anywhere in the house,wireless
These are laptops that virtually live on a wireless network,wireless
The work computer is primarily wireless at work all day and practically flawless,wireless

I have to hard power cycle the router to get the wireless to come back up,wireless
About 6 months ago I bought the Linksys wireless router with speed boost for my house,wireless
Set it up easy enough and had great connection with the wireless in the room it was set up in,wireless
Now recently a friend wanted me to set up a wireless network at their house,wireless
The DIR-655 installed without a hitch and works well with several Linksys wireless G adapters I have,wireless
"The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130s reports that they are attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this setup replaces",wireless
"Not only that, my wireless n/w goes kaput; the movie I was watching on Netflix stopped working",wireless
"Some times it loses the wireless connection, may be it is only my router and in this case I always make the reconnection",wireless
"Worked fine with a Linksys G wireless router, but when I switched to a DLink router (the Linksys died from a power surge), the Expander become unreliable, frequently dropping the signal & requiring repeated setups",wireless
"Works well if you have a Linksys G wireless router and an area of poor coverage in your house, otherwise don't bother",wireless
"The linksys worked like a champ for the past 2 years, but I now have a wireless laptop to roam about the casa",wireless
I figured wireless-G was the way to go instead of feneygling with Cat-5 ethernet cable over 50 feet,wireless
"Well, the problems began soon after I installed the netgear router; the wireless laptop AND a wired desktop kept loosing the internet",wireless
"This is the second Linksys wireless device I've tried, and neither was worked for me",wireless
"I followed the directions carefully, and after about the 6th location in my house, I got the two flashing blue lights to go steady indicating it found my household wireless signal",wireless
"Using the supplied software, it was unable to insert itself because said heavy handed s/w would trash my wireless network before it could connect to it",wireless
"Ever since I packed up the WRE54G, my laptop's wireless has been down",wireless
My modem and wireless router is fine,wireless
other computers can log on via wireless with no problems,wireless
"If anyone has a suggestion about which wireless settings may have been corrupted, please chime in",wireless
We have had this wireless router for over a year when suddenly it started dropping the connection,wireless
)  Then I realized this started happening when he got his new PDA which connects to our wireless router,wireless
The problem does not occur when he connects to the wireless router but as soon as he disconnects either the PDA or work laptop then I can not connect with our home laptop computer,wireless
We have the mac addresses for the PDA and his work computer configured in the wireless router and the problem continued,wireless
<p>A wirelessly connected laptop that is usually operated one story downstairs and two rooms away (about 40 feet straightline) from the router unit usually connects at 2MBPS,wireless
"In fact, I use a Linksys wireless router at home with a Linksys cable modem and have never had any problems",wireless
The main problem with this router and most wireless devices is a dropped connection,wireless
) It seems many people are not familiar enough wireless networks to find out that 802,wireless
"Microwaves, Bluetooth devices, and even other wireless networks can cause enough interference",wireless
"Whether you're directly connected to it via Ethernet or using the wireless connectivity, the connection goes dead every half hour",wireless
"Linksys appears to be doing nothing about this problem, and the only solution that's been found anywhere is to put a network switch between your computer and the router, but that still doesn't help the connection drop on the wireless which, needless to say, is a serious problem for a wireless router",wireless
"The router had been out for almost a year before I bought mine and still there was not a fix for the guest network, and not to mention again the daft design choices or not being able to reboot the the device or turn on the wireless without pressing a hardware button",wireless
"Seemed very sensitive to placement relative wireless router: too far it couldn't connect or keep connection, too close it didn't offer much range expansion",wireless
"It frequently resets, and restarting it with autoconfig requires turning off WiFi security, requiring resetting devices  wirelessly connected to network",wireless
"If I hadn't erroneously convinced myself it was helping my network range, I would have returned it within 30 days and purchased a wireless n-router and 802",wireless
At the moment I am using it for wired purposes so I cannot comment on its wireless functionality however wen i start my pc b4 i can get conected 2 the internet i have to unplug my router an plug it bak in again and at times it drops connection,wireless
"I'd open up the list of available wireless networks, it would tell me that I'm still connected, but it just wouldn't allow me to connect to any sort of outside internet site",wireless
"It recognizes that there is a wireless network available, it is just incapable of connecting to it, in both encrypted and open modes",wireless
"after updating the firmware using a pc, this wireless router works perfectly with mac os x and the airport (802",wireless
Had trouble setting up both wireless and straight ethernet and tech support wasn't much help,wireless
I threw it in the trash and bought a Netgear wireless router,wireless
"With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem",wireless
"If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers",wireless
"However, if you are not a tech person and just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it",wireless
"All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G",wireless
"I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G",wireless
"If you are a simple user who wants secure wireless access in your house, this is a great router for its price",wireless
I can totally depend on it for months on end but alas it is not wireless,wireless
"The only problem is, It won't connect to any of my wireless devices (laptop, desktop, phone, PDA, Kindle or gaming console)",wireless
11B router and cards (connected to a wired Win XP desktop and two wireless Win XP laptops) for almost two years without a problem,wireless
"My old Linksys router never dropped the VPN connection, wired or wireless",wireless
"I called them because the brand new Wireless-G Range Expander (WRE54G) from Amazon was not providing a strong enough signal for my wireless laptop to pick up, even when they were side-by-side and in the same room as the wireless router",wireless
Myers (another reviewer of the WRE54G) to get a WAP54G and configure it as a wireless repeater instead,wireless
"So i returned that and the wireless card which worked fine, to best buy and got a full refund",wireless
I am not a computer geek but a normal user who wanted to have a wireless setup at my home,wireless
I've used wireless routers before and never had any problem,wireless
So spend you money on a new wireless router with extended capabilities,wireless
"This allows me to increase the wireless connectivity range and provide for more wired locations in different areas of my ""compound""",wireless
2 laptops (Dells) 3 Desktops (Built with componets from Amazon and Tiger Direct) 1 Home Server (HP) 1 Wireless Printer (brother) 1 XBOX (Playing those games which love the bandwidth) 1 WII 1 Bright-View movie gadget 1 Cisco ATA for Vonage voice line We needed one more of these wireless WDS gadgets and was considering using a 3500 since they have served me well,wireless
All repeaters and their wireless and wired devices had no internet/intranet connection,wireless
This feature is a requirement if your are using an wireless printer and do not have access to a Domain Name Server,wireless
The only benefit was the mircowave powercorn machine did not interfere with my wireless laptop,wireless
"I had no problem in setting up the router initially, but when I set up Guest network access, the wireless radio was disabled for all SSIDs",wireless
"This firmware update immediately fixed the problem, and I now have a stable Guest network running alongside the regular wireless SSIDs- the principal reason I upgraded to this router",wireless
After much pain and suffering at the hands of this router not being able to stay running for more than 1/2 hour with two wireless connections (causes both wireless and wired side to freeze up) I managed to get a lot of good information on why this is the case,wireless
I have had no luck getting the Wireless function accessable from my wireless PC's,wireless
"I bought a Linksys router a few years ago, and upgraded to this model after getting a new laptop with wireless capability",wireless
"I enjoy the convenience of wireless, but miss the stability of my old Linksys",wireless
The only difference I've seen between the two in features and functionality is the wireless part,wireless
If you decide to go wireless don't use Linksys,wireless
"Loved the set up, got the wireless network up and running no problem in 20 minutes",wireless
"Since then, I've been very pleased with the product, both wireless and wired access",wireless
"But this is my first experience with a wireless router, and I have no idea how to do a manual install",wireless
"I found this unit to be constantly going ""off-line,"" losing its synch with my main wireless access point",wireless
I tried using this device to extend the range of my wireless-b network,wireless
I have had wireless-b (WAP11 version 1 plus router) for about 4 years and wanted to extend the range into a redone garage,wireless
The wireless router came without a power cord and i was never pre warned about this,wireless
"The only reason this isn't in the bottom of the trash can in pieces is because my roommate refuses to give up her wireless ""convenience",wireless
"Until they had me mess with it, the wireless router worked perfectly fine and ALL I wanted was to extended my range to weak areas in the house",wireless
"I'll keep it simple: I purchased, 10 year DSL user with several wireless routers successfully working",wireless
"Also, if you try it, then can't use it, be aware that its setup will overwrite the wireless control configuration on Windows XP SR2",wireless
"You'll have to turn that back on, and re-set-up your wireless network",wireless
"lasted 8 weeks, 3 weeks after I bought it the wireless quit and 8 weeks later port 1 is gone",wireless
"Therefore, I cannot recommend this equipment, however, if you are stuck with it, you can generally make it a useable product by either a) leveraging a vaunted by manufacturer small footprint in your fridge, thus preventing overheating b) sparely use wireless only for occasional surfing, do all work which counts using wireline",wireless
"I popped the CD into a wireless laptop, and two minutes later both lights were blue",wireless
Now the router needs to be reset every ten to forty hours because of wireless link DHCP loss,wireless
You are better off with an engenius product or and seperate wired router with an wireless accesspoint connected to that,wireless
I've had one of these wireless routers for a couple of years now and it's life is coming to an end,wireless
"Randomly it seems, none of my laptops can connect to the wireless",wireless
I am therefore retiring this wireless router,wireless
I've never read more mixed reviews for any piece of technology than wireless routers,wireless
"Settings and trouble verified by a friend who has the same router, but doesn't use it for his PS3, only for it's wireless, which is flawless! [verified, has, does, use, 's, is] [same, wireless, flawless]

"Matching speedbooster wireless card connects to the internet only when it feels like it, even in the same room as the router and with 100% signal strength",wireless
"My computer is Microsoft XP, Pentium 4 I got a wireless Built in my computer , so I dont need a Wirelss card,   Netgear 614 has had lots of Problems, Resetting password problems,  the products came with a Installation disc",wireless
However it was unstable and constantly required resetting (the wired connection) not the wireless,wireless
"The first year or so, the router worked just fine for wired and wireless connections",wireless
So went to buy a wireless n router for cheaper and a promise not to buy any netgear product ever,wireless
"I recently bought this product and set it up and it was working great for 24 hours when the whole unit just stopped broadcasting the wireless signal completely, so i restarted it and the signal came back",wireless
This wireless router (if you are going to use it as your main wireless router) is great,wireless
But if you are looking for a device that is going to be able to bridge a connection and function as a wireless router you are looking in the wrong place,wireless
But if you are going to use it for a main wireless router you are fine,wireless
I ordered this wireless router based on what other said about its quality,wireless
I'm adding a MacBook wireless connection using Mac OS internal Airport,wireless
"Next, Bellsouth DSL, which I have used for years and like for its remarkable uptime abilities, provides no documentation whatsoever about making a wireless connection to its router",wireless
It was very aggravating having to reboot the router all the time and had to be in the same room for the wireless to work,wireless
Pros -Great amount of features and customization -Awesome 1GBPS wired connection -Good price Cons -disappointing wireless speed,wireless
"Built in ""good neighbor policy"" is prohibiting wireless n to run at 300mbps and instead falls back to 150mbps",wireless
Overall: Great unit if your neighborhood is not congested with wireless networks,wireless
Here's the short version:<p>Wired or wireless connections internal to the network work fine,wireless
"Over wifi, using a wireless N machine it ranges from 6 down 2 up and worse",wireless
I have several computers and a HP Laserjet4 (13 years old and functions perfectly) I am hooked to my ISP's shared T1 with a wireless connection,wireless
"The configuration page does not render properly on any of my three Macs, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless connection",wireless
I bought this router in addition to a Linksys wireless laptop range extender  PCI Card and a wireless PCI adapter for my desktop,wireless
"The only immediate problem I encountered was getting wireless settings set up for my Mac on wireless, but that wasn't too much of a problem",wireless
"I bought the Netgear WGT624 wireless router and I get FULL signal, thats right, 99% signal where I only got 50-60% (if I was lucky) using my ""Expanded"" Linksys network (with the Linksys high gain antennas too! [bought, get, thats, got, was, using, Expanded] [wireless, FULL, lucky, high]
",wireless
This is despite the fact that all three of the computers in my house are Vista and communicating on a Linksys wireless network,wireless
I have been using a Cisco-Linksys WRT54G wireless router with fairly good success,wireless
The router is 7 yrs old and figured while upgrading a completed home theater system maybe it was time to upgrade the wireless router,wireless
"I haven't figured out why, except that rebooting the wireless router fixes the problem, so I'm pretty confident it's an issue with the router",wireless
I have also had problems doing large file transfers (>100 MB) from one of my LAN machines to the laptop over wireless,wireless
"I'm not certain if the router was at fault, Vista, or the wireless driver on the laptop",wireless
Many hours of phone calls to Linksys says all is fine and Comcast says it is the wireless router,wireless
Disconnected WRT54G and dusted off an old wireless B router and all was great,wireless
However after about 6 months the router began to reset randomly - at first I thought there was a problem with the router until one time I came back to find someone trying to surf my network - turns out that the default setting for the wireless option is enabled with no WEP encryption - so a LOCAL hacker had taken to resetting the router using an easy network call and then surfing into my network using the wireless link,wireless
i get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers,wireless
As of 6/7/10 there is a known glitch that makes the proudly trumpeted guest network inoperable and/or removes secure wireless encryption,wireless
"Update (2/21/2009):  I just set up a new AirPort Extreme router wirelessly (! [set] [new]

even the conventional router (non-wireless) does not work anymore,wireless
"Since my primary wireless router is D-Link, it will not work with it, and I have to buy a 2nd WAP54G to make it work",wireless
"I'll have three hours of no problems, then suddenly for the next two hours, I'll randomly lose internet access on both my wireless and wired connections",wireless
"Tech support could usually get it going again, and eventually I learned some of the tricks they gave me for resuscitating it: ipconfig through the command window, changing the wireless channel, etc",wireless
I couldn't move one room away from the router and maintain the wireless connection through a single wall at a distance of around 30 feet,wireless
"I noticed that any time my laptop detected multiple wireless signals, my wireless connection would fail",wireless
Later a friend gave me a Linksys Compact Wireless-G router that had the very same problem with its wireless signal dropping whenever there were other wireless signals in the area,wireless
"It only worked when I gave it to my parents, who live in a remote area where no other wireless signals can interfere with the Linksys wireless",wireless
"Unfortunately over the past 11 months I had to repeat this 3-4 hour tech support call for other, out of the blue sync issues with the wwireless router",wireless
"In addition to the sync problems and lifeless customer service technicians, the two antennae wireless router has some of the weakest signal strength I have seen",wireless
Fortunatley for me I got a new 2WIRE 2701HG-B wireless modem/router with no external antennaes at all,wireless
Then it took 5 minutes more to set up my 2nd computer to the wireless signal,wireless
It causes the wireless clients to get confused and which access point to use and every so often goes red for no apparent reason and screws up the network,wireless
I had the WNR2000 and I wanted to upgrade to this POS hoping to get a better reception for my X Box wireless connection which I use for HD Streaming,wireless
"This also includes some direct router connections, not just the wireless signal",wireless
I was replacing my linksys wireless-g because it would reset too often,wireless
If you use Vonage and are using a Linksys wireless router -- beware,wireless
Purchasing this range expander (or wireless print servers and other wireless accessories) will result in an unbelieveable waste of time and money,wireless
Ditch Vonage or ditch hopes of an expanded range wireless network unless you want to connect a router in addition to your wireless/phone router,wireless
"<p>I went as far as turning off the one wireless phone, even though it was not operating in the 2",wireless
The home owner did not know of any other wireless devices in his home,wireless
We purchased a new wireless router only to discover that the product was three years old and the warranty had expired,wireless
"Considering I am using this in conjunction with a Linksys wireless router, I would be expecting a much better experience",wireless
The wireless worked,wireless
I used the wireless in various parts of my house and was disappointed in the range,wireless
<p>I then tried to connect to the Internet using one of my other PCs connected through the hub (non-wireless),wireless
A friend really likes his D-Link router/wireless unit,wireless
"I don't know whether I just got a bad one, but the wireless range and signal strength are terrible",wireless
"It doesn't supply a decent wireless signal within a regular house, even at short ranges",wireless
"In my house, this is the router that we use to connect our Cable internet  ~2 mb/s) to 6 wireless computers",wireless
1) I explained my problem with my two week old NETGEAR wireless router and was clearly told that NETGEAR does NOT provide ANY after sales tech support for AMAZON customers,wireless
My wireless signal disappears once in a while (even cannot find the router in wireless connection list),wireless
I've spent several hours trying to get my Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander to work with two different wireless routers (one of them a Linksys router),wireless
"Con: The wireless functionality of this router is good when it works, but frequently (I would say 70%? [is, works, say] [wireless, good]
",wireless
I have not considered turning off encryption; if this is causing the router to become unstable then I would consider the wireless piece to be worthless because I don't want other people to use my internet connection,wireless
"If one doesn't appear soon, I'll be returning my DIR-655 and buying a Netgear wireless router",wireless
"Most strkingly the connection I have is 20Mbps which I get directly only from modem or from this router only thru ethernet cable, while I go wireless, if falls significantly in its best positioned antena in a one 1 ft away to 4-5 Mbps which I feel is not worth of its price",wireless
Short and sweet: This router's wireless G connection lasted a week then completely died,wireless
"Following which the wire connection to a laptop on a docking station failed to work - the laptop on the docking station could 'see' the Router but not the network or internet, other wired computers were fine and turning the wireless on (and then off) on the docking station laptop resolved the problem",wireless
The only issue I had setting it up was in the config wireless menu,wireless
It kept loging me off everytime I tried to change a wireless channel (the higher ones),wireless
"However, after a couple of years, it developed a more annoying problem: the wireless network would go away and then come back repeatedly - anywhere from several times a day to several times a minute - on all my devices (2 laptops, Droid phone, and a Roku box on the TV)",wireless
"This was somewhat annoying, though, because the device does not have a hard-wire ethernet port so each step of the way, you loose the connection with the device as you change the wireless settings",wireless
"I can see why they'd do this to reduce the configuration needs on your wireless devices; however, this means that once the SSID is set to the same as the other wireless device, if you need to continue to configure the WRE54G, you'll have to turn off your other devices or go to a spot that you're sure is out of range of your other devices so you can be certain you're connecting to the WRE54G",wireless
"However, when we got to the part where I mentioned the model of the other Linksys access points I have, she (well they) basically told me that they were only supporting this device with 3 particular wireless-G access points",wireless
"This is the product I've been waiting for for years--a way to extend my wireless network without using two wireless devices, a wireless repeater",wireless
Do yourself a favor and stay away from DLINK wireless routers (or at least this one),wireless
"I wanted to configure this item as a wireless-n access point, but they were unable even to grasp my question",wireless
I bought this to replace a 4 year older wireless N router that broke,wireless
Router was a snap to setup and relatively easy to configure wireless with the NetGear 802,wireless
The laptop connecting to the router is approximately 6-7 feet away and is using an intel wireless adapter,wireless
I have never had a problem with a wireless connection from this laptop its a very good wireless card,wireless
Only other thing is my brother claims he pushed the button on the top (if using the vertical mount) to try to fix the wireless connection (he obviously didnt know that was just for the quick connect feature),wireless
"I still have my Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless router which still works perfect, except for only being wireless-B",wireless
It installed somewhat easily and except for a little problem with the wireless PC card for the laptop (wouldn't be recognized at first but easily corrected) we had pretty stable use for about a year,wireless
As of right now I don't know if we'll be buying another Netgear router & wireless PC card,wireless
I've had this router for 6 months now and have spent countless hours/days/weeks/months trying to fix an intermittent Internet connection loss both on the PC to which it is hard-wired and a wireless connected PC,wireless
"Fine on the hard-wired PC; however, the speed on the wireless connected PC is less than half the speed of the hard-wired one",wireless
Unfortunately that machine is Window 98 and needs a B-wireless unit,wireless
Get a wireless router from your internet provider and save yourself a big headache,wireless
I do not know of the other brands of wireless routers but this one is poor range wise,wireless
"Seems to need a power cycle periodically to restore decent wifi access, especially with my wireless network printer",wireless
"I tried to go through the installation instructions for the wireless range expander and found that my PC system consistently failed either to find the range expander in the network, or that it could not be set up and run properly when it could be found",wireless
I reset up my old wireless G Dlink with WPA and it too kept loosing connection,wireless
Only after I purchased a New Gear router did I learn what reliable wireless Internet was all about,wireless
"To my knowledge, it hasn't lost its link with any of my wireless devices a single time in the 6 months I've been using it (not including a couple iPod Touches I have, but that's par for the course with those, I suppose)",wireless
"However, remember you wanted wireless, so don't complain about signal strength when you're 100 feet away from the router",wireless
If the office was on wireless G I would have bought another one of these for it,wireless
The wireless speed and range are horrible--Seemed like I had reverted to my old dial-up modem,wireless
"If you were hoping to use the ""share port"" feature to set up a wireless print server or wireless external hardrive DO NOT BUY",wireless
"After two members of my family received computers for graduation presents, it quickly became clear that wireless Internet access would be needed in order to suit everyone's needs",wireless
"Not being a tech guy myself, I did a bit of online research about wireless Internet routers and purchased this one, as it seemed to be the most commonly used",wireless
I would steer clear of anyone wanting to buy this wireless router,wireless
Cheaper and easier to buy a wireless access point and put it in repeater mode,wireless
especially since you can plug in a cat5 cable to configure the wireless portion,wireless
"I'm above average on wireless network knowledge and my opinion is this product stinks! ['m, is, stinks] [above, wireless]
",wireless
It seems the wireless antenna lasts about 9 months,wireless
The range is worse than my older wireless g router,wireless
Isn't this suppose to be a wireless router,wireless
My old router has wireless bridging capabilities,wireless
"I have, at last, installed the linksys wireless system including the router plus the wireless USB card",wireless
My previous wireless router (Netgear) lasted 5 years,wireless
First the wireless would shut off after a few minutes,wireless
"It lacks the ability to route UDP packets reliably through the wireless, (No VPN or internet gaming), it stops routing wireless packets to the internet intermittently, requiring a reset",wireless
"4 different wireless devices a Dell laptop, A Desktop with a DLink wireless G card, A Palm TX, and a Blackberry can't connect to it",wireless

The Positives - the speed is undoubtedly there for our wireless devices,wireless
But the biggest headache was setting up my wireless HP printer,wireless
It also frequently seems to not recognize wireless devices it once did and I have to unplug it for around 30 seconds then power it back up again to get it to work,wireless
At first I blamed wireless interference from my neighbors but after connecting direclty to the router via ethernet cable I could still not get a connection,wireless
"OVERALL:  I need something like this, so it was either fidget with this until I could get it to work, or I was going to have crappy wireless in that part of the house",wireless
So my desire for better wireless gave me the patience needed to put up with this,wireless
I bought Linksys's wireless router because after doing some research and from a personal recomenadation from a friend that had their four-port router (the non-wireless equivalent) I determined that they were the best,wireless

"The wireless function to all my household laptops was terrible, dropping out and not being able to hook up to the router about every half hour",wireless
I bought this router for its wireless and wired capabilities and price,wireless

"The setup wizard on the supplied CD does not run on either of my wireless PCs, both have Linksys cards installed, and I have found no trace of any firmware upgrade on the Linksys site for this product",wireless
"This router works well when you use the wired network, however, not being able to use the wireless defeats the whole purpose of a ""wireless"" router",wireless
"I purchased my router from bestbuy, and after a month of use, I kept getting disconnected from my wireless connection and the signal would decrease as soon as I connected",wireless
"Old versions gave horrible performance, wired and wireless",wireless
I work for a commercial wireless equipment provider and I can't believe that they could have shipped the original version,wireless
"But we don't compete, I don't do domestic wireless",wireless
I cured this by adding a commercial wireless device to one of the wired ports,wireless
"This restored reliable wireless Internet for a month or so, but then the wired side started dropping out",wireless
"<p>To make things more interesting, before I found out that the second replacement was faulty I ordered this product and Linksys's wireless print server from amazon for our other office",wireless
<p>Hey for [the money]it's still not a bad deal for a wireless router even though it does not work quite right,wireless
I bought this unit to replace a wireless DSL gateway in my home,wireless

Not up to speed with Centrino computers - requires endless tweaking to make a reliable wireless connection,wireless
"As a wireless access point, connection fails when the USB adapter is in a room, and the router is in another room perhaps 60 feet away with a right angle turn",wireless
"If you are serious about your wireless network, though, I suggest going with a more powerful router, like the Cisco 1202",wireless
Put the router on the first machine and installed a wireless card on a PC in the basement,wireless
I put the wireless card in a laptop and was able to get full 11Mbps transmission while in the same room as the router,wireless
"Great if you live in a small studio or one bedroom apartment, but in that case do you really need a wireless product",wireless
"The ethernet still worked but the main reason I purchased a wireless router was because its a ""WIRELESS"" connection",wireless
"However, I've had all sorts of problems with wireless connections; everytime I reboot my laptop it takes a few DAYS to get it to connect again! ['ve, had, reboot, takes, get, connect] [wireless, few]

"I have a Linksys wireless network in my home and three computers, all running Windows XP",wireless
I bought this router a few months ok wanting to upgrade from the basic Linksys wireless router,wireless
"Using the router's simple web interface, I configured WEP keys for the router &amp; my wireless card",wireless
"So anytime I want to use the router securely, I've got to: 1) disable WEP on my wireless card 2) re-acquire a DHCP address 3) regenerate WEP keys with the router's web interface 4) enable WEP on my wireless card with generated key 5) re-acquire DHCP<p>You may imagine this makes security prohibitively inconvenient",wireless
So I'd recommend it only if you are planning for continuous uptime or live in an area where you don't have to worry about others intercepting your wireless transmissions,wireless
"Currently, although I am happy (sadly enough) to say I can use the internet with this darn thing hooked up, I cannot get it to produce a wireless signal",wireless
I bought this router to form a wireless bridge between a netgear WNR3500L and this unit,wireless
I also attempted to pair this with a wireless N adapter to connect a machine in the same remote room,wireless
I was totally unable to get this to cooperate with a the dlink extreme wireless N PCI express adapter,wireless
"By contrast, with the WNR3500L acting as my master router, the dlink wireless N card functioned okay with a average throughput around 3",wireless
I cannot advise using this unit to form a wireless bridge,wireless
It might work fine if paired with a different wireless N adapter,wireless
"On a side note, I bought a second WNR3500L in order or form a wireless bridge and found the performance similar to pairing the WNDR3700 with a WNR3500L",wireless

In a prior review I wrote that the Linksys wireless router was a nice addition to my notebook computer after I adjusted to the range and speed being less than 1/2 of the published performance specifcations,wireless
"This is the first wireless router I have purchased and Im pretty content on how fast it is, I get the same speeds(when Im close the the router of course) as if I had the cable connected",wireless
"It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC",wireless
"3) Crashes ""just because"" sometimes, 4) The wireless security protocols would not allow us connect iphones, our playstation 3, or our Wii to the network until I turned off wireless WEP encryption and set up MAC Address filtering instead",wireless
This was a great router in 2000 and it would probably work really well for my parents or grandparents that just want to do email and maybe surf the internet (especially if they are running older OS systems with older wireless hardware),wireless
At checkout I realized the product number and item changed to the WGR614 wireless router,wireless
"Linksys wants you to buy wireless g routers and their newest, latest, thing, not this one so no support",wireless

This product is a real PAIN to add into a Linksys wireless network,wireless
I'm still not sure how well the expander will perform since I can only use it for about an hour before my Linksys wireless network locks up,wireless
"1 router setting which plays havoc with wireless Blu-ray players, wireless TVs, iPhones, etc",wireless

I have it in the same spot as the old wireless router,wireless
"I have a new laptop and thought using a new wireless router with ""N"" would make it faster and the reception better in my home",wireless
I didn't have to do this with my old wireless Linksys,wireless
"I started my quest for better wireless coverage looking at the HGA7T antenna, and read a report there suggesting the Linksys WRE54G range expander device was a better solution",wireless
The concept of the WRE54G is a good one - the ability to extend the wireless coverage,wireless
"Also, I hope you realize that once the WRE54G is installed, it cuts your effective wireless throughput in half (which may or may not matter, given that most people's broadband bandwidth is still slower)",wireless
"I'm moving on to try the HGA7T instead - a fraction of the price of the WRE54G, much simpler solution that should be ""good enough"" and provide a stronger wireless signal that has better coverage than a single room (oh yeah, the WRE54G supposedly only boosts the signal significantly in the room in which it's installed, and the antenna should increase the signal broadly around the house)",wireless
"The management utilities from D-Link and NetGear allows me to reboot the router, even thru wireless",wireless
2 ) Anytime a cordless phone is used in the house it knocks out my wireless connection,wireless

""" As the other posts note,  you'll need a substantial knowledge of wireless technology to ever get it to work",wireless
I had to try two wireless cards in my PC before getting a signal (but this may have been the fault of my first wireless card),wireless
"It freezes up constantly, wired and wireless",wireless
we have two wireless computers on the network and we are constantly being kicked off about 10 times a day each,wireless
the only solution 80% of the time is to unplug the wireless adaptors and replug it,wireless

"Also, by using aftermarket external antennae with your wireless NICS (not all of them support them), you can get more range from the unit",wireless
"Install was a snap, I have WPA security installed on my linksys wireless router",wireless
"Immediately saw increase in signal strength on all my computers with wireless adapters (desktop with linksys usb wireless adapter, dell laptop with intel wireless minicard, dell laptop with pcmcia wireless adapter)",wireless
"Channel number for the linksys wireless card (also version 4) was not configurable, if it was different from the default channel 6",wireless
"<p>Since I was very happy using Linksys's WIRED 4-port router before, I was willing to spend more bucks to buy a wireless router from linksys again, which turned out not to be as good",wireless
"If you don't know what that is (like I didn't), it's the early version of wireless-N",wireless
"We (Cisco and I) eventually got it in sync with my wireless router but it only amplified the signal by approximately ten feet, if that",wireless
"In both wireless and wired mode, the XP was extremely slow when using the browser",wireless
I would bring it down to my home office and reset the wireless connection,wireless
"Not only does it work properly, but it also has a max wireless speed of 450 mbps at in the 5g mode",wireless
"In addition, I tried to use this AP for *only* hard-wired connections (turning off all wireless devices at home), and over time (30 min or so) the hard-wired computer would lose its IP address over DHCP, and I couldn't get a new one",wireless
"<p>So now I've standardized on Lucent Orinoco wireless gears: 3 silver cards (2 for laptops, 1 for a iPAQ 3650), 2 RG-1000 APs, and life is wonderful",wireless
I changed my wireless channel and a few other settings hoping it was a fluke,wireless
"=)  I hooked my WRT54GL ""Molasses Edition"" back up and away we sailed on our wireless G network in less than a minute and no disconnects",wireless
"Tried a variety of settings after hours of investigation on many Apple and D-Link forums but no luck, would get intermittent wireless disconnects almost daily",wireless
Really wanted to keep this router but re-setting up the ATV wireless connection everyday was not very convenient,wireless
Would not recommend the DIR-655 for those who have a first gen ATV on their wireless networks,wireless
"I've owned this router for a couple years now, it is a solid wireless router with easy interface etc",wireless
But ALL wireless routers are very poor for network data transfer,wireless
I get 5Mbps internet and this router (WPA2 remember) get's a top consistent transfer to my laptop (wireless 802,wireless
"I pull full 1Gbps off my Linksys SD2008 switch, wireless n, when standardized won't even touch a quarter of that in real world use",wireless
"This router works great when it's up - great speed, excellent range on the wireless, and 54 Mbps throughout the entire house",wireless

Switching from an Orinoco or a Cisco wireless card on the laptop was easy and no problems there either,wireless
<p>Performance:   I will review only the wireless part this,wireless
It was a little slow on some of the more heavier network utilizing applications but its wireless you can't expect the speed of a Lan line,wireless
I bought this wireless router to use with my laptop in my house,wireless
I have so many issues with using this router for my wireless laptop,wireless
Every week I need to reconnect it wireline to the network in order to have it keep working wirelessly,wireless
The wireless range was terrible and was a step down from my old Dlink wireless G router,wireless
I then purchased an IPad 6 months later and it couldn't connect to the wireless,wireless
It got worse when we tried to bring in the laptop as part of the network and became a nightmare when we tried to resolve the issue of why the laptop couldn't print through the router/wirelessly,wireless
"I just wanted a wireless router that works, with security that's easy to set up",wireless
When I finally connected the router guess what it would not hold a stable connection both wired and wireless,wireless
"But when I started using the wireless connection, the connection between router and modem died",wireless
Like many of us I needed to expand my wireless signal to another building,wireless
After some setup tine with their foreign techs via phone I was now ready as per their instructions to call linksys support and have them configure the devices wireless MAC address into my linksys WRT160NL wireless router,wireless
He suggested that I get their WRE54G range extender which would work with their wireless routers,wireless
"Logging into the router itself, while plugged in or via wireless, was a bit laggy",wireless
"The wireless signal was decent, but not a significant improvement  over my 802",wireless
It means that one of the supposed differentiator feature for this router doesn't work and you have terrible experience trying to backup things - it doesn't matter if through wireless or wired connection,wireless
"By this time, my wife was getting pretty frustrated with the old Asante router (it needs to be power cycled once a day for the wireless to work)",wireless
Bought this wireless router as I was seeking a dual band router with a dedicated N band and guest network,wireless
Another real plus was the range of the wireless signal on both G and N,wireless
The eight year old Linksys B this replaced (due to it needing reboots 4x daily) was faster both in wired and wireless forms,wireless
"To those USERS of wireless technology who are fortunate enough to know technically gifted folks who will hold their hand, let me echo many sentiments and add a new caveat: 1) Set-up is NOT far the feint of heart; it is challenging",wireless
"When I recently purchased a laptop with integrated wireless I grabbed this router off the shelf, excited to setup a wireless network at home right away",wireless
I sometimes still have a hard time getting the router to work unless I plug in and then unplug the ethernet cable once I'm accessing the wireless network,wireless
I bought one of these in July of 2011 and have been using it as the only wireless access for two teenagers and two adults,wireless
It hosts both Ethernet and wireless devices on both 2,wireless
It is now June 2012 and in the last 2-3 weeks we have all been noticing that the wireless access has become very flaky,wireless
In a different part of the house I have another wireless network that passes its traffic back to this Netgear access point over Ethernet and find that this second wireless device is very stable and fast,wireless
"<p>If you use a wireless adapter, forget it",wireless
"Wireless clients show strong signal strength connecting to the box, and indeed the box's 'wireless lan link' light is lit",wireless
"However, the box refused to provide DHCP service to any wireless clients",wireless
<p>There are a bunch of wireless routers out there,wireless
"I recently replaced it with a Netgear wireless router, which works perfectly",wireless
And now the Linksys wireless router is where it belongs,wireless
"In some ways, this wireless router works as you might expect",wireless
"After a month of usage, the router decides that, every evening at some point, it would no longer connect any wireless devices",wireless
"No dropped wireless, faster than the Netgear (even when it was working), and has, hands-down, the best router management UI of any router I've had (and there have been quite a few)",wireless
"The router worked fine with direct CAT5 connections, but totally failed with wireless connections using the WMP11 cards",wireless
"Like most other wireless-n devices, this router is not compatible with the old WEP security and would default to 54M maximum speed",wireless
(3) The bypass account feature does not work with a wireless bridge in combination with the router,wireless
I eventually had to take the computers off the bridge and used wireless adapters on each computer to do the work,wireless
"*** UPDATE:  So, day two, after 86 minutes on hold with tech support, the second tier tech support informed me that the reason I was having wireless issues is because there is no ALG configuration ability for this router",wireless
"So if you buy from Amazon and need wireless, you might be screwed",wireless
"I know how to replace a router and set up a wired/wireless network, adjust the security protocols, etc",wireless
All this hassle is not worth the extra 10 Mbs I get wirelessly,wireless
Speeds were horrible with the wireless option turned on or off,wireless
Hard lined or wireless i should have been getting something better since i have anywhere from 10mb to 20mb cable modem speeds,wireless
"I've had a wireless b connection for years that works perfectly, thought to buy the g to speed things up, and am so frustrated i'm going to throw the unit in the trash",wireless
"Furthermore, I cannot get the router to work with my Dell Lattitude computer which has a built in wireless card",wireless
"Did my usual research on Amazon, Cnet and Newegg before choosing a new wireless router as I was hoping to get a better wireless range than the one I get with my old and trusted Linksys wrt54g router",wireless
"Sometimes it connects to a drive I attached, sometimes not,  wireless isn't any better",wireless
"I own my own business doing network &amp; computer consulting and I am going to make sure that if my clients are looking for wireless, they are going to stay far far away from Linksys",wireless
It would be nice to actually have a users manual for the exact product instead of one that roughly mixes all of their wireless routers together,wireless
Speed did not increase neither did the range of the wireless reception,wireless
"I was really excited to finally get an N router, an upgrade from my Linksys wireless G WRT54G2",wireless
net rated my home pc with a connection of up to 25mbps connection and wireless speeds around 15 mbps,wireless
"Hooked up to the D-Link extreme N, connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps",wireless
"Worked great for 22 days, then i wasn't able to connect wirelessly",wireless

The router is on a separate floor on the other side of the brick wall from the wirelessly connected computer,wireless

Never had a drop off issue with the Linksys but have to often reconnect my Notebook PC to the Wireless and often loose internet access via wireless,wireless
Router works GREAT hard wired but the wireless is very unreliable just like other reviews on here have warned,wireless
"Also, I had much better range on wireless G on the Linksys than I do on this router",wireless
I've had my first wireless router in 2003 and had upgraded to several brands of router past years,wireless
"After 9 month of good service, it drops internet connection every couple of hours both wired and wireless connection",wireless
It looks I will have to  buy the G wireless router,wireless

"I'm running a minimal configuration, nothing fancy beyond password protecting the wireless",wireless
The Linksys WRT54G and WRT54GS routers have been the number one most popular wireless router devices available for the past few years,wireless
"However, the earlier WRT54G product has now been replaced with a less powerful wireless product (version 5) that has had its onboard flash RAM chopped in half from 4MB to 2MB and its system RAM cut from 16MB to 8MB",wireless
There is nothing wrong with using VxWorks and over time Cisco will probably work out the bugs but for now the newest wireless routers are not reliable,wireless
"Why would Cisco do this to its most popular Linksys brand of wireless routers? [Cisco, do] [popular, wireless]
",wireless
The open source Linux firmware with the large amount of flash and system memory was attractive to many third party independent software developers that were turning the WRT54G and GS routers into powerhouse micro Linux wireless computers with a functionality approaching and often surpassing the $600+ wireless routers that Cisco sells,wireless
"Finally, if you do plan to flash your WRT54G with third party firmware the  ones before version 4 of the WRT54G wireless routers are supposed to be easier to work with",wireless
"For the WRT54G wireless routers look for CDFA or a CDF9 or lower (CDF8, CDF7, 6, etc",wireless

"And by the way, it doesn't matter whether or not I'm wired in or wireless",wireless
This router is easily overloaded and struggles to deliver the full N speeds across the wireless network,wireless
I am not sure that there is really any wireless router that lives up to it's promises,wireless
The Netgear wireless router product is apparently in working order because I mailed it to my son in Tennessee who got it to work just fine on his equipment which is the same as mine,wireless
<p>The first had the problems described - in fact the router would crash within a few seconds of wireless activity,wireless
"I am doing PPPoE in Mindspring (Baltimore), the wireless and CAT5 works great and setup was straight forward",wireless
Internet connection would drop even though the wireless connection would stay connected,wireless
"Fortunately, I have a wireless connection that allows me to access the web from my laptop while in different rooms of my house, but that's where the product benefits stop",wireless
All other devices beyond a few feet are no longer detectable this wireless router,wireless

I finally gave up when I tried to add a wireless bridge to the network and all of the other devices lost their connections,wireless

"First, the way it works: This expander essentially emulates the set up of your wireless router",wireless
In summary: If you have: 1: NO OTHER wireless hotspots visible to your computer (unlikely); 2: NO SECURITY on your own hotspot (not recommended); You should be able to have this thing working fine,wireless
"The symptoms are: No routing; No wireless, or slow wireless; No response to ICMP pings; No response to web configuration; Status lights do not indicate a problem; No DHCP server",wireless
"The wireless section still worked, as I could access the internet with my iPhone through the wifi section",wireless
Running the install CD on 2 different computers actually completely disabled the internal wireless modems with no warning,wireless
"The first question the guy asked was if my wireless router was broadcasting it's SSID, it doesn't for security reasons",wireless
"Works well, sometimes there are some issues with the signal probably because there are a lot of wireless router on the same building",wireless
"This caused the wireless part of the router to fail, although naturally it took quite a while for me to figure out what happened",wireless
"got up one morning, the wireless network connection was completely missing",wireless

"The Belkin also drops the wireless connection now and then, although not nearly as often",wireless
"Configuration was easier with the Belkin, too, especially the wireless password",wireless
This makes it so much easier to add your computers to the wireless network,wireless

Maybe once a week or every other week I have to unplug the thing and plug it back in because both the computer that's directly connected to it and the wirelessly connected computer suddenly won't get any info from it,wireless
I think next time i buy a wireless router i may look into the NetGear,wireless
"My only complaint about that dinosaur is that it suddenly looses the 5Ghz wireless connection when streaming a lot of video, probably because of overheating",wireless

I bought this product to add range to my old toshiba laptop that only utilizes a wireless g network connection,wireless
All are connected via mixed mode b/g/n wireless network with no problems other than the fact that the old toshiba laptop gets a poor signal because it only picks up the  802,wireless
Running the router in g or b mode only is a problem because it cuts the wireless download speed of the other attached devices from 17mbps to about 8mbps according to the FCC online speed test,wireless
"The other option is to run an Ethernet cable from the router to the wre54g, which is a problem because it defeats the purpose of purchasing a wireless range extender in the first place",wireless
Bottom Line: this product can be useful if you are connecting it to a wireless network that ONLY uses 802,wireless
I bought an Asus N12 router to flash with WW-DRT and use as a wireless repeater for my 360 across the house,wireless

I am personally not so familiar with computers but it should not be so difficult to hook up a wireless router and I had a lot of trouble with this,wireless
I bought this product to replace my two year old wireless G Linksys router which I was having to reset constantly,wireless
I went with wireless N because I wanted more range,wireless

"Once it was setup, I found that wireless devices like laptops and iPhone 3G had difficulties picking this device over the weaker Linksys WRT54G wireless router",wireless
I think the problem is that this device uses the same SSID as your wireless router,wireless
So the only time this device will be really useful is if you are completely outside the range of your wireless router but within range of the range expander,wireless
I would suggestion moving to a new wireless N wireless router,wireless
Most models also have improved wireless G range over older wireless routers like the Linksys WRT54G,wireless

"I have used a Netgear switches and routers for many years with no problems, so when upgrading my Netgear FR314 router to a wireless router, I stayed with the Netgear line",wireless
I bought this because my existing wireless network was very weak and slow on lower level of my duplex apartment,wireless
"After the incredibly difficult (I have set up quite a few wireless networks before, and I do IT consulting for a living, so I can only imagine how difficult this must be for someone without networking knowledge to install) setup process, my signal downstairs did improve dramatically, to 95%, but the speed seemed to be reduced even further, to the point where it was near unusable",wireless

"Tonight, I got home and the wireless connections would not work right",wireless

The place I take issue is this when I had it hooked up at our house I found the wireless would go down every 6 days this was a regular occurrence,wireless
"After trying a couple other wireless routers in this range that stunk, I settled on the WRT45G, and have been satisfied with the results",wireless
(I am not using the Linksys wireless card in my laptop - not sure if/how that would affect speed),wireless
"It communicates with my ISP/cable modem (Motorla surfboard) just fine, but on the internal network, the dynamic IP allocation did NOT work with my Belkin wireless card, so I had to set up my machines with static IPs on my home network",wireless
"Both routers I tried were Version-B; however, even though the wireless connection showed 11mpbs, 100% signal strength (since I was only 3feet away), yet was very slow, about 2k transfer from the internet",wireless

My old Netgear router work for like 3 years and I got rid of it because it was only 10 mbps and I upgraded to the linksys 100 mbps and I wanted to use the wireless but it looks like I should have gone with netgear,wireless
"For example, when the WRE54G detects a 54 Mbps connection with a WAP54G, WRT54G or WRT54GS, it will relay approximately half of the transmission rate to the wireless clients that are connected to it",wireless

"After a few hours the NetGear WNDR3700 went offline, amber light, and through various attempts cannot connect wirelessly, via cable, update firmware or even reset default factory settings to troubleshoot issues with the router",wireless
"However, in the last two days, it has been going out to lunch for no reason that I can see: while the unit shows activity on its Internet and  wireless LEDs, and it continues to show up in a scan for wireless networks, it will not issue DHCP leases on the LAN side, and it will not respond to ICMP pings from either the WAN or the LAN sides",wireless
"Since NetGear says my support options all involve me paying money, I expect to buy a new wireless router with a different brand label",wireless
"That is, until I tried to configure the wireless network for it",wireless
"I'm not a newbie to wireless networking or networking in general (in fact, I managed a large CISCO-based WAN/LAN for 6 years)",wireless
I tried connecting with three different machines (each with a different wireless-g adapter) that worked fine on my old wireless router,wireless
"In addition to the wireless problems, the router would also drop my wired connections every so often just for the heck of it",wireless
Since you must setup the unit wirelessly (no ethernet connection is available) whatever wireless connection you are using to setup the unit must not be in range of any other wireless domain but your own,wireless
"Whenever I tried to configure the unit using my wpc54g equiped laptop, my laptop would loose the original wireless connection to my network and connect to my neighbors wireless router instead of the wre54g",wireless
"The basic wireless (A/G/N) seems to work well, though the A/N range is disappointing",wireless
I eventually was able to get it to join with my existing linksys wireless network in a way that is not covered by the documentation,wireless

"I have tried changing the network cables, switching between wired and wireless connections, etc etc, but none of them helps",wireless
The only good thing I see with this is good wireless signal strength,wireless
"After a series of tests on my modem, computer, laptop, wii, roommates laptop, iphone and other devices I realized it was definitely the wireless router",wireless
"But, this is the third Linksys home wireless router I have bought over the last three years, and ALL of them have taken returning them, until I get one that is actually made correctly, and I spend hours tweaking them and becoming ""friends"" with the technical people at Linksys--most of whom are not the ""brightest pennies in the roll""",wireless

5 Ghz band has very good range and throughput and I haven't had any dropout problems like I did with the DIR-655 even after switching to the Ralink drivers and wireless manager,wireless
It offers WPA2 for wireless security and I was up and running under 5 minutes of turning it on,wireless
If you are looking for a wireless router that has great hardware performance and is easy to setup and use this is a great product,wireless
If you want a wireless router that has a lot of configuration options look elsewhere,wireless
Only good thing I have to say about linksys is their chat system reconnects instantly if router/wireless/internet goes down- and the subsequent session was able to reconnect with same rep and not have to regurgitate my history,wireless

To make it more interesting I decided to extend my existing wired network with the Linksys wireless router,wireless
So I plugged my network cable into the UPLINK port of my wired router and into the WAN port of my wireless router (there are 4 DOWNLINK ports and one WAN port,wireless
") Now, it would seem more logical to plug the network cable from UPLINK port to UPLINK port, but there isn't one on the wireless router",wireless

The laptop 100' from the wireless router and 10' from the WRE54G would constantly pick up the router instead of the Range Expander,wireless

"Also, you will not be able to use third party firmware with this version of the router",firmware

"Maybe, given enough time, they will come out with a firmware that makes this thing work, but I got tired of waiting",firmware
"The agent also told me to never update firmware through GUI because that could ""destabilize"" the device :-) They do provide RMA (after extensive phone troubleshooting), but you'd have to pay $30 in case you'd like a replacement device being delivered the next day",firmware
"Because of the initial set-up issues, I am afraid to perform any maintenance as a firmware upgrade, enable other features, etc",firmware
DLink support told me not to upgrade firmware unless I have real problems,firmware
Pros: Large Screen Easy input of addresses Connectivity for upgrading system and maps Fairly quick download times (30 minutes for both the firmware and map) Cons: Touch screen is buggy Glare on the LCD Clunky interface Poor routing capability Inaccurate listing of some addresses,firmware
I even looked for a firmware update their was none available,firmware
"D-Link technical support could not fix, either through firmware update, configuration changes or with a replacement router",firmware
"Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers",firmware
"2 of the technicians told me to upgrade the firmware (which was already upgraded) and to reset, so many times, that I got extroadinarily frustraqted and asked to talk to a manager",firmware
"04 of the firmware loaded, I could manually input the device MAC address into a field provided and the device worked fine with WEP encryption",firmware
"And yes, I was using latest firmware bit the bullet and ran wire directly to the room with the week signal and do not regret the effort",firmware
"There are many supposed after market firmwares for this router, but none of them work on Version 6",firmware
"3) I upgraded to the latest firmware as of Nov 2008, still tons of issues, it works after I reboot cleanly for 5 mins or so, then wireless connections keep falling very frequently especially if I'm using more than 1 wireless or wired connection, also my PS3 and Vonage were not performing as well as before",firmware
I have updated it to the latest firmware using the Garmin Updater tool and still it has problems,firmware
"Luckily, my girlfriend who is rather computer literate ( I am semi)  bought one of these units a few weeks ago and was able to guide me through the quirky set up using the web site to update the firmware and the maps",firmware
So I upgraded the firmware to the newest v1,firmware
After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine,firmware
Linksys is supposed to support PPPoE beginning with firmware version 1,firmware
<p>The current firmware version is 1,firmware
While I applaud Linksys updating their firmware frequently I was not happy waiting for the PPPoE support to be fixed and already returned the unit,firmware
The problem has gotten worse - I have installed the latest firmware for this router - still loses its signal every five to ten minutes,firmware
"After 5 HOURS on the phone with 4 different ""tech support"" experts, they had me upgrading firmware, then downgrading firmware, and finally running my cable from the modem thru a 10base-t hub",firmware
"Interestingly enough I have had 2 ""firmware"" upgrades that the router identified that it needed within this period of time, which I think is odd",firmware
I downloaded the new firmware at least 3 times,firmware
I decided to try the latest firmware (1,firmware
I went back to the older firmware (1,firmware
I used the built-in utility to check the firmware and it told me that I already had the latest,firmware
"In a final attempt to get the thing to work, I updated the firmware to version 1",firmware
"1) I bought this product for the SecureSpot feature and found out only after a very long, frustrating discussion with a less-than willing Customer Help Desk that SecureSpot is not yet available on the Rev B Hardware, and DLink has no idea when it will be added to the firmware",firmware
"Before this, I owned a Netgear router that was working great, until I bought new vista computers, and Netgear decided not to upgrade their firmware to be vista-compliant",firmware
"The sad but fated conclusion: A new firmware promised to fix the bug, so I thought I'd be a power user and download it",firmware
"Note to Linksys: if your firmware download page has seven or more downloads specifically for the WRT54G, you should give the end-user an obvious link telling them how to determine which WRT54G to use",firmware
"I submitted the firmware up to the router, and it went to a blank page that said, ""Don't interrupt this",firmware
"After 15 minutes, the page hadn't auto-refreshed, so I opened another tab and logged in, and the router was chugging along with the old firmware",firmware
"Well, I won't invite armchairing by further details, except to state that the router briefly reported itself as running the new firmware, but still wouldn't DHCP my wireless devices, then wouldn't DHCP my wired device, and finally wouldn't respond at all (brick had been achieved)",firmware
"The firmware is the latest version, tried cycling power several times with no luck",firmware
"I tried upgrading the firmware, playing with the frequencies, the speeds, disabling the 5GHz options, and it continued",firmware
I have downloaded the firmware and upgraded it; actually replaced it since my device shipped with the most current version supposedly already loaded,firmware
After firmware upgrade it works well for normal router and WAP functions,firmware
I would definitly avoid this unti untill a few firmware updates are out,firmware
"I then followed the instructions on the two top-rated posts (basically disabling security, downloading and upgrading firmware, then re-enabling security)",firmware
So here's what I suggest: #1  Make sure you have downloaded the latest firmware for your router and the range expander,firmware
"Then suddenly for no reason ever 10 seconds i would lose connectivity ,  I tried everything I reset, updated the firmware installed some hacked firmware",firmware
"After a few hours the NetGear WNDR3700 went offline, amber light, and through various attempts cannot connect wirelessly, via cable, update firmware or even reset default factory settings to troubleshoot issues with the router",firmware
"The hardware is worse than version 2, which was good because it allowed installation of custom firmware",firmware
"Now it is impossible, you have to stay with the company's firmware, which is plainly bad",firmware
"33 or higher firmware, it makes it lots easier",firmware
"He sent me advice, firmware updates, and we emailed repeatedly and found solutions to the problems",firmware
"I isolated it to the USB storage, a bug that was supposedly fixed in the latest firmware but was apparently not fixed",firmware
"D-Link is no longer supporting this product with firmware updates, so based on the above mentioned issues and the lack of future firmware updates to fix some obvious bugs, I can't recommend this product",firmware
It might be a hardware problem and it cannot be fixed by firmware upgrade,firmware
"After contacting COX they said I may need to upgrade Firmware on Netgear router, so I downloaded the latest firmware and upgraded router",firmware
"Installation was easy, firmware had to be upgraded to the latest one (laptop refused to connect without that)",firmware
I couldn't  connect to it from my PC to upgrade the firmware because it was stuck in  self-test mode,firmware
"Yes, I updated the firmware, first day installed",firmware
"(Why doesn't this come with the most recent firmware? [does, come] [recent]
",firmware
"Anyway, he gave up after 30 minutes, and said I'd have to upload new firmware to the router",firmware
"I tried downloading and installing new firmware, and the router wouldn't except any update",firmware
"would you believe that their tech rep said he would email me the firmware update, eventhough I couldn't access email (that was why I was calling him)",firmware
So I went to netgear's website to download the latest firmware,firmware
"With the firmware image ready, my next task was to get the Netgear device back up and running so I could access its setup page",firmware
"Anyway, I got the thing to boot, and loaded the new firmware image on it, then restarted the router",firmware
"On the failure page that results, you can find a link that takes you to the ""basic settings"" section, which is essentially the menu system the old firmware used to set up the router",firmware
"Like I said, though, I planned to replace the stock Netgear firmware with DD-WRT to get those advanced features",firmware
"Don't consider this router, though, if you want to run an alternate firmware or are looking for a router with more advanced features",firmware
However the firmware upgrades from d-link made the router less and less favorable -- they're buggy and hard to get everything set up correctly,firmware
"The worst -- the latest firmware upgrade bricked my router and the built-in emergency backup system failed to bring the router back to life! [bricked, failed, bring] [worst, latest, built-in]
",firmware
"<p>The professional technician who installed the router and network card spent about 5 hours trying to tweak it, including downloading updated firmware from Linksys, but to no avail",firmware
"However, I have to take 2 stars off for lack of stability, ESPECIALLY with recent firmware upgrades",firmware
"Some versions of the firmware don't play World of Warcraft - miscalculates the checksum for a particular packet, leading to the game being a 'ghost town'",firmware
First thing I did was updating the firmware,firmware
I was very pleased that the newest version of the firmware includes WPA,firmware
I was hoping the newest firmware would fix the problem but it didn't,firmware
"When I chatted with the Linksys support, he claimed there were only firmware differences",firmware
"<p>Most recent firmware you say? [say] [Most, recent]
",firmware
"Other folks suggested a new beta version of the firmware, but it still has lockup issues too",firmware
"I'm a computer engineer by training and tried everything I could think of - changing the the channels (one by one), updating the firmware to v10, hardware reset, playing with the preamble and tuning other parameters - all to no avail",firmware
<p>I've tried a half dozen different versions of Linksys' firmware versions,firmware
"I've upgraded the firmware, but that only established the connection until the next day when it failed again",firmware
"If you have the WRT54G router, go to Linksys and download the latest version of the firmware",firmware
"I've seen 2 firmware updates, but neither made any apparent improvement in stability or features",firmware
"Apparently the hardware is good but the setup software, firmware and tech support are abysmal",firmware
"I'm guessing that this problem can be resolved via a future firmware update from Linksys, but who knows when that is coming",firmware
Linksys must perform little or no quality review of their firmware,firmware
The signal strength problem that lead to my purchase was due to a bug in my WRT54g's firmware (2,firmware
"4 firmware, I am currently running at between about 36% and 52% signal strength, which provides a minimum of 36 mbps, higher than the maximum 27 mbps (54/2) that the WRE54g can deliver",firmware
"I guess the setup CD makes a great frisbee - it certainly does not help with setup, as it couldn't detect the WRE54g, even with WEP and MAC filtering off, and broadcast SSID on, and using a wrt54g router having the latest firmware downloaded from Linksys (2",firmware
I checked the website and noted the existence of new firmware,firmware
The new firmware's date was 6/8/04,firmware
"04) date was 5/8/04, so I thought the new firmware would help things",firmware
"Too bad the link on Linksys's website resulted in the download of yet another useless version of the WRE54g setup utility, no firmware included",firmware
"Here's what Wikipedia has to say about this device: ""Known issues As shipped, the Linksys firmware crashes under heavy peer-to-peer network traffic, such as BitTorrent",firmware
"Briefly, it involves installing a 3rd party firmware",firmware
And there's not enough memory in this thing to install a full version of DD-WRT (3rd party firmware) so you're essentially SOL,firmware
"After about 10 failed attempts, I managed to flash it to newer firmware",firmware
When an firmware upgrade was available (1,firmware
"Tech suppport was reasonable, gave a few firmware updates, but didn't help",firmware
Also it's no wonder that this company releases so many firmware updates and hardware revisions,firmware
"VXWorks Junk, September 8, 2006 Reviewer: Bryan Garrett ""skunkwerx"" - See all my reviews Do NOT purchase this unit thinking you will be able to upgrade the firmware",firmware
This is NOTHING like the old versions of the WRT54G and GS routers that would allow opensource firmware with lots of flexibility,firmware
The first tech thought I needed to upgrade the firmware and told me where to download and to call back if I needed more help,firmware
240 (user blank and password admin) in my web browser and connect to the expander where I could install the new firmware,firmware
"It took me a bit to work out what was going on because I initially left the neigbours IP settings in manual (which is fine when intalling the firmware) but after using the setup disk you need to go back to automatic! [took, work, was, going, left, is, intalling, using, need, go] [fine, automatic]
",firmware
"The firmware which came out on the 29th January does not help resolve the problem, although they claimed that it will solve some compatibility issues with CISCO chipsets, etc",firmware
Nor would it accept a firmware upgrade (this was a V4 running the 1,firmware
but would not come close to saying they had bad hardware or firmware,firmware
Perhaps it is just the recent Hardware version 4 and the firmware,firmware
"Also, contact Linksys to get the latest firmware to update the extender -- the updated one supports security better",firmware
I am also having great difficulty trying to install a third party firmware on the router,firmware
"This router was a gift; I have set it up with the factory firmware and no one complained about the WiFi a signal dropping, or slow connection speed",firmware
"Also, the features don't come close to the terrific Trendnet firmware -- for example, port forwarding only allows you to forward the same port on the WAN side as LAN side (I usually forward port 222 to port 22 on one machine and 223 to 22 on another)",firmware
"I called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware, but this did not solve the problem",firmware
<p>I ended up performing a firmware upgrade and re-configuring the router,firmware
"No change, nothing worked (I had DL the latest firmware upgrade for the V5 hardware (1",firmware
"After all this time, the tech tells me that the hardware is new (WRT54G v5) and that there are known bugs, these are two, and the Linksys is working hard to come up with updated firmware",firmware
The only thing that was different wast he firmware,firmware
"After a lot of work they had me change my firmware to an older version, 1",firmware
The process of upgrading the firmware went like this: 1) Upgrade firmware throught the IE interface,firmware
"2) Push in & hold the reset button for 30 seconds 3) Unplug & replug the router 4) Re-enter my settings (because of the reset) The first time I upgraded the firmware, they skipped step 2! [Push, hold, replug, Re-enter, upgraded, skipped] [first]
",firmware
"So I don't know if it's the firmware version or if it's reseting the router, but my main constant dropped problem is solved",firmware
"After trying this for a couple of weeks I'll upgrade to the current firmware to see which of these 2 is the cause of the problem, as well as seeing if it fixed my OLD problem of having to restart the router  a couple of times a week",firmware
"As a result, you won't be able to flash it with third party firmwares",firmware
"After she suggested I 'kindly' update my firmware, my set up wizard crashed and I couldn't access half of the router's website anymore! [suggested, update, set, crashed, access] [website]

"Followed instructions to upgrade firmware (shipped in 2012, but had older 2009 version it it? [Followed, upgrade, shipped, had] [older]

"I have tried moving the router to a different physical location, changing the wireless communication channel, and upgrading the firmware from the Netgear website",firmware
"A few years ago, I was one of the unlucky 'early adopters' of a Linksys 4 port router (wired type) and, for almost a year, had to endure continuous firmware updates before Linksys got that router's problems fixed",firmware
Two phone calls were made to Linksys tech support during which a firmware update to the 54G router and multiple resets of my cable modem and the 54G and reboots of my computer were required to get the 54G to connect on the WAN/Internet side of the router to the cable modem,firmware
"For anyone using older firmware, I recommend upgrading it by grabbing the image from the Linksys site",firmware
the product failed after a firmware upgrade,firmware
"I tried downloading the latest firmware, but to no avail",firmware
"If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router, I'd give it 4-5 stars",firmware
"""  After having some other problems, I took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware",firmware
"Then today, after being instructed to reset the router, it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade (there was no apparent way out of this)",firmware
Worked great until the new firmware that installs SecureSpot,firmware
You may ask why not go back to the old firmware,firmware
"So, overall, I have to give this excellent piece of hardware 2 stars because of D-Link's awful recent firmware and support",firmware
"If it was possible to revert to an older firmware, perhaps I would feel differently, but I have been forced to replace the router with a non-D-Link device as I work from home and need reliable internet connectivity and VOIP",firmware
"<p>  After repeated calls to the terribly unhelpful ""technical support"" (who seemed convinced that the problem was everything BUT the router - very suspicious - and who sent me firmware that refuses to install) and a sore neck from long hold times (at least 45mins",firmware
"This one had the latest firmware, so the bridge option was removed by Dlink",firmware
"The linksys people were clueless also , the sent me 3 different firmwares, but none worked ( even beta ones)",firmware
"50, resetting my router to default, then resetting the new device to default, then upgrading the firmware on the new device (which I downloaded before I changed the ip to static)",firmware
"The main problem is that you can't see the thing on your network and it has no port to connect to, so you can't configure it or upgrade the firmware--which is worthless and unusable",firmware
"I've held on, hoping that a magic firmware update would be issued that would make all of the issues disappear",firmware
"My firmware is up to date, I've re-started it 50+ times, my internet is working fine (I'm on it now thanks to my old router), I just cannot get the router to connect to the internet",firmware
"With the newest firmware, the b devices and g devices work together very well",firmware
"If you load that firmware, your wireless throughput will drop even further, and many of the functions like creating secondary ethernet bridges will completely cause the WAN to quit working",firmware
"This router use to be great, but with the new version 5 it's only got half the memory and can't be my 4rd party firmware installed",firmware
I didn't go for that because I had already tried the router somewhere else and used DD-WRT firmware which didn't work either so I knew it was not a software issue,firmware
"i've upgraded the firmware, i've even took my router to my friend's house to see if the problem is universal, and yet it is! ['ve, upgraded, 've, took, see, is, is] [universal]

Turns out this version is very buggy and can't be upgraded to aftermarket firmware,firmware
The latest version of this product model has less RAM and runs a different firmware (essentially an operating system) than previous versions of the same product,firmware
As others noted below this router drops local connections constantly (2 to 3 times daily) I did not have this problem until I updated the firmware to the latest release: 1,firmware
Have been updating new firmware whenever a new one is available,firmware
"However, with every new firmware, the quality seems gettign worse",firmware
I had to go through talking to three or four   really novice support people before I finally got someone that gave me a firmware upgrade so that   the box would work,firmware
"The instructions on the self-help support webpage lead me to upgrade the firmware, and once that was complete, I have not been able to connect to the unit again",firmware
As soon as I got it I downloaded the latest firmware (end of May 2010),firmware
The advantages of the 1490 are all for naught without reliable firmware which this device lacks,firmware
"I have not tried 'eco route' related functionality I have updated map and software - so it has now latest firmware and map Basic functionality - add address/search address , navigation,interface is fine now i feel following issues - if anybody has any input let us know 1) when unit start - screen loads after ""I agree"" button ,it always make noise like ""spark "" or radio tunning for fraction of second and then it become normal",firmware
"after updating the firmware using a pc, this wireless router works perfectly with mac os x and the airport (802",firmware

I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it,firmware
"Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware",firmware
"So, if you type in ""Linksys firmware"" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux)",firmware
"The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be",firmware
"Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware",firmware
"This is the 6th version of their firmware and they still haven't solved the problem! [is, have, solved] [6th]

"I don't care if DD-WRT is better, I believe the router should work and be functional first with it's firmware",firmware
"Downloaded the new 54G driver for the card and firmware for the router - still nothing (router is set to mixed mode and B card has latest firmware and driver, I also uninstalled the B card from my wife's laptop prior to installing the new G card)",firmware
"The router's ""stay alive"" feature disappeared after installing the new firmware update",firmware
"He had me execute almost the same routine that I had perfomed prior to calling: I rolled back the card's driver to original (Win XP roll-back feature), uninstalled and reinstalled card from the control panel with reboots, reset the router, and rolled back to router's original firmware -- nothing",firmware
The 3700 now sets on a self waiting until firmware is released indicating these issues are fixed and my wife has forgotten about the struggles over this past week,firmware
"She then had me download a beta version firmware update, Version 1",firmware
"This firmware update immediately fixed the problem, and I now have a stable Guest network running alongside the regular wireless SSIDs- the principal reason I upgraded to this router",firmware
Hopefully the new firmware version will be posted soon on their website,firmware

"Talked to Linksys tech support and suggested new firmware, hopefuly this will fix the problem",firmware
"I've updated the firmware, replaced the router with a newer one, and called tech support several times",firmware
Updated the firmware even though I have no idea if that's good or not for this product,firmware

"I installed the router corretly, upgraded the firmware, secured the network (using WEP), and tweaked all the settings, including disabling content filtering and the firewall, in the hope that it would improve performance",firmware
"Tried several firmware upgrades and downgrades, still no help",firmware
I'm hopeful (and expecting) that Linksys will release new firmware correcting this problem,firmware
"After I completed setup, I noticed that this router would not list my network printer as a device that could be assigned a DHCP reservation, so I accepted the suggestion on the internal management website to check for a firmware upgrade",firmware
"After a long session with tech support, I finally was told that the firmware recovery utility on the CD is apparently not expected to ever work, and they asked me to return the unit for a refund, which I did and ordered a D-Link",firmware
"I know what I'm talking about, as engineering manager for a company that makes (not networking) products that have updatable firmware",firmware

"I have upgraded the firmware, portforwarded and done everything i could possibly do, but every other day i have to come home and pull the power plug to the router, wait for it to reboot then get on the internet",firmware

"Even though it was their firmware update that trashed my unit they would not make good on it claiming it was out of warranty, which it was",firmware
<p>The problem comes in with their firmware,firmware
To put it simply you could consider this device to be in beta testing at the firmware level,firmware
"Since I have been fairly happy with it, I decided to get the same one again (version B1, firmware 2",firmware
Endless firmware updates dont make a difference to the range - its a poor design,firmware
"The firmware update will ruin your router, and there is no fix available",firmware
It worked fine until the firmware updated to the latest version,firmware
"Before the firmware update, the 5G band was weak too",firmware
There was a suggestion from a customer to downgrade back to old version firmware,firmware
"After yet another long call to India the latest tech support rep acknowledged that lots of these models are having the same problem, and upgrading to the latest firmware (which I did immediately upon installing both of these routers) won't fix it, so her solution was",firmware
"com/gp/product/B000BTL0OA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/181-7332158-2732331"">Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router  (Compatible with Linux)</a> with firmware upgraded to DD-WRT which performs flawlessly",firmware
"I think Linksys changed the firmware, rendering the unit useless, but then they won't offer help",firmware
I decided to just throw in the towel and return it rather than deal with another one with questionable build quality and firmware,firmware
"I tried firmware upgrades and downgrades, but the problem persists",firmware
"I've seen no evidence of the Wifi disconnect issues that others have, but I immediately updated to the latest version of firmware when I set the router up",firmware
I have the latest firmware and I have not changed anything else in the set up on either this router or my cable modem,firmware
I downloaded all of the latest firmware updates from Linksys to no avail,firmware
"If you go there, check out the reviews, warnings, and horror stories about the WRT54G V5 router, the WRT54G series altogether, and Linksys' refusal to acknowledge any problem or put out any firmware that is in the slightest bit useful",firmware
0 Mbhs) to see if there is newer firmware,firmware
"Yes, the V3 died on me and was not great either, but upon doing some research after all this, I feel that with the available 3rd-party firmware available, a V3 would be my best bet",firmware
"I verified that I was, indeed, using the latest firmware from Linksys and that the problem was continuing",firmware
He told me to search for another V1 trough V4 WRT54G and upload some third party firmware on it,firmware
"I brought it home, plugged it up and immediately downloaded what is presumably some of the best third party firmware available for these routers",firmware
"The firmware not ony makes the router reliable, it makes it more powerful as well",firmware
"I know that it must sound like I am peddling this firmware or something, but that's only because it has saved me so much grief",firmware
"You download third party firmware (be sure to download and install it plugged into the router, not wirelessly) You don't waste your time with Linksys customer service or tech support",firmware
Obvious the problem is their firmware,firmware
"I guess the firmware is written to detect pointed object movement, instead of finger movement",firmware
"Upgraded firmware, did a factory reset, nothing helped",firmware
I updated to the latest firmware and it's even worse,firmware
So she gave me a silly excuse that the Dlink notebook adaptor needed a firmware upgrade,firmware
it had the latest firmware,firmware
"After trying for a hour trying to find the right setting I was missing, I checked for a firmware upgrade and there was one (for warning, the upgrade takes away all your settings so back up your config)",firmware
The second time I called (which was only 3 hours later) they tell me that something is wrong with the firmware inside the product and that I would need to replace it and send it back because they aren't getting a response from the product,firmware
I got another Linksys and updated it with latest firmware,firmware
"Please note that the ""auto-firmware check"" does not detect the latest firmware",firmware
com and put your model number in to download the latest firmware,firmware
"So I had to go through the same process of giving him all the information about me, the serial numbers, model numbers, firmware version, phone number, blah blah - Again! [had, go, giving] [same, serial, firmware]
",firmware
"No matter what channel I selected and after applying the latest firmware and recommended technical support troubleshooting, the signal strength was always ""very low"" and communication from the remote PC via the WUSB54G adapter was consistently intermittent",firmware
I updated the router with the latest firmware,firmware
"Speaking of which, it needed an immediate firmware update because the one that shipped had a bug that would turn off the antennaes when a guest network was enabled, but no worries, it was corrected in the update",firmware
I updated the firmware straight out of the box and DLINK is apparently ok with allowing customers to waste endless amounts of time trying to correct a problem they caused and are aware of,firmware
I have gone to the Netgear forums for help and i have done all the standard troubleshooting like updating the most recent firmware but this does not help,firmware
Linksys hints that they'll support WPA via a firmware upgrade in the future,firmware
"this router is pretty stable for me, but the firmware, the admin console has a few bugs and inconveniences, and it seems netgear doesn't really respond to fixing them all that quickly",firmware
if netgear is smart they better come out with a firmware update that fixes these problems fast,firmware
the version 5 is junk ive been disconnected 2times a day and i have there newest firmware,firmware
for the love of god i downloaded 5 updates on firmware and the only thing its cahnged are the slow dwnlaod speeds NOTHING ELSE it still disconnets,firmware
"I've tried a firmware upgrade, I've tried changing the MTU size, and next I think I'm going to try another brand of router",firmware
I then asked her if I should do a firmware update and she said I would need to go to their website and match up the firmware I have with what is current on their site,firmware
After several hours and a firmware update through the software I got the router up and running,firmware
What's more frustrating is there is nothing on the linksys support site and the firmware has not been updated since December of 02,firmware
We started having a lot of disconnects and a firmware update did help a lot,firmware
"They advertise a network storage capability with the latest firmware update, but my IT guru brother and I could never get it working which is too bad",firmware
"Searching the web for an answer, I read a firmware update corrected some of the problems (why did I get one with known problems? [Searching, read, update, corrected, did, get] [firmware, known]
",firmware
"During the attempt of updating the firmware it shut down again, guess that froze up the router for sure",firmware
"While surfing the web, I read someone mentioned to update the firmware from Linksys for a problem which was totally different than mine",firmware
Getting a bit better after updating firmware manually,firmware
All I get is the firmware upgrade screen,firmware
I contacted Netgear and they agreed that this was a problem and it was going to be fixed in the next firmware release,firmware
They stated that the firmware was in the final days of testing,firmware
I would not purchase this product until the new firmware is released,firmware
"Three phone calls to D-Link technical support finally revealed that aside from the USB port sharing capability on the router, there is no solution addressing the ability to truly share printers efficiently across the network as of 08/22/2009, and no estimated date for a software or firmware update",firmware
"If you run torrent's or any P2P, run for cover and get the WRT54GL, which is basically this router with the memory (double) and firmware of Version 4 before they cheaped out",firmware
"Also, forget about using 3rd party firmware with Version 5 also",firmware
"In my efforts to identify routers that provide NAT Loopback Support, I discovered DD-WRT: ""DD-WRT is a Linux based alternative OpenSource firmware suitable for a great variety of WLAN routers and embedded systems",firmware
I flashed the DD-WRT operating system onto the Asus router with absolutely no problems by doing a firmware upgrade,firmware
It also had a decent amount of options in the firmware,firmware
I've upgraded all the firmware and tech support is useless,firmware
Edit: Switching the QOS OFF appears to prevent spontaneous reboots with firmware version 1,firmware
"I've had a Ver 2 of this router for about a year, and the thing works flawlessly, and I can't remember any major problems with it, once I got the latest firmware for it",firmware
Even with the latest firmware update the connection will drop randomly,firmware
"This item was easy to set up and offered fast surfing but firmware updates are far and few between, I have owned for one year, constantly loses internet connectivity, crashes, the customer support is worthless, don't waste your money on this one",firmware
"When it goes down, you have to reset or download new firmware or generally spend hours trying to figure out what went wrong with it",firmware
"I have WRE54G version 1 and on the advice of tech support and various Linksys articles, upgraded my firmware",firmware
When the support tech came back online I asked him to point me to an earlier firmware upgrade,firmware
"I suspect that the latest firmware was designed with V2 in mind, not V1",firmware
"During this 7-hour tech call, they had me install a new version of the firmware, which resulted in the router not working at all",firmware
"Called D-Link tech support and after being walked through all of things I had already tried, I was asked what level of firmware was in my router and instructed to download the latest firmware and told to call back if that didn't fix it",firmware
"It does not run Linux anymore, so there are no firmware alternatives",firmware
"You also have to update the firmware, but the dLink support site is pretty easy to use",firmware
Be prepared to have issues fixed as new firmware comes out and all of the sudden your other hardware is functional again,firmware
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this unit, with firmware 1",firmware
They don't even have the option of loading the older firmware in order to re-enable the video,firmware
I downgraded to the original firmware (factory default) and streaming worked fine,firmware
He emailed me a file containing a firmware upgrade (version 1,firmware
Just had the new firmware pushed to the router so hopefully that fixes some issues,firmware
"Upgraded firmware, WAN port turns 10Mbps, works fine with cablemodem, but LAN ports got stuck at 10Mbps, too",firmware
"Linksys' tech support was really bad, didn't even know about the latest firmware which I had to advise her on",firmware
"This class of devices cannot fail, and even with the latest firmware this one does, a lot",firmware
My DIR-655 was working great until I upgraded the firmware to version 1,firmware
"3x firmware, it will be slow and require a reboot about every couple of days",firmware
Tried different firmware's from,firmware
Router died while going through firmware upgrade (reset by itself while in the middle of firmware upgrade) Pathetic piece of equipment,firmware
Buyers beware if you have constant reset problems on this router do not upgrade the firmware on it,firmware
"a month later: Again to start the same: - lose connection - automatic test in the router is activated - connection is still lost - connection is restored (1 or 2 minutes) I checked for firmware upgrade, I did this, and reset router and other config details but the problem still continue and as the 3months warranty expired",firmware
"After many attempts to fix this, including updating the firmware from Linksys's website, refreshing the factory settings and following the Easy Set-up again, it still did not work properly",firmware
"10 of the firmware, but using this version, the router didn't work with one of my friend's wireless cards",firmware
With the GS you'll get MORE processing power and more ram so you can use cooler Sveasoft firmwares,firmware
"The setup wizard on the supplied CD does not run on either of my wireless PCs, both have Linksys cards installed, and I have found no trace of any firmware upgrade on the Linksys site for this product",firmware
As an added perk this router allows you to change the firmware and install DDWRT on it and enable dozens of more features only found in very expensive wi-fi equipment,firmware
"I updated every driver and firmware on several different routers and the range expander, all to no avail",firmware
"We buy the same model and expected to be the same but turned to be a wrong decision, the current one (bought at Walmart at 02/2010) is actually a different model: WGR614v9, with only 8MB Ram and 2MB flash Rom, only half of the WGR614v8, and more important no more Qos in router firmware, it is much slower than the WGR614v8, especially under heavy load thus need manual reboot",firmware
"constantly drops the connection with rogers 3mb service, i DO NOT recommend this product, the only SEMI-FIX is to upgrade the firmware and PRAY for the best",firmware
"com/easy , clicking on NetUpdate to download the firmware upgrade for v",firmware
"After a couple livechat sessions (they were helpful but sort of went the roundabout way and didn't get me to the final solution), I finally spoke to someone on the phone for support who noted that I not only needed to do a firmware upgrade (basically software for the router to work) (which I already discovered is a different firmware upgrade for v",firmware
5 needs a firmware upgrade and help from a program you can get online to get it to work,firmware
I was on the phone with DLink support for 3 hours to have them walk me through upgrading the firmware and reconfiguring the router,firmware
"The latest firmware ships with 'Advanced DNS' as 'enabled', by default",firmware
Setup was easier because XP had the drivers on-board and there was no need to download and install firmware upgrades,firmware
My Complaints: 1) Total PITA to uprade firmware,firmware
"Also the newest firmware package I found was from 2004, so basically cisco doesn't support this router anymore",firmware
"To resolve the issue, I had to update firmware multiple times",firmware
They refuse to update the firmware to make it stable while downloading media files,firmware
Both of mine are version 4 with the latest firmware that will NEVER be upgraded by linksys,firmware
I also installed and configured one of these units (with the v4 chipset) for a neighbor and found similar problems - eventually I had to *downgrade* from the latest firmware to get DHCP and WEP to work at all,firmware
"After upgrading the firmware, the router is very unreliable",firmware
"It still had problems, even with the newest firmware update",firmware
"I wrote this purchase off and reinstalled my old (before the Cisco acquisition) Linksys router (same model number, but earlier firmware version)",firmware
"All for not, after 6 months it drops all wi-fi connections after a few hours of running old firmware or latest",firmware
"I tested with different firmware versions and various setting adjustments as recommended by other users experiencing the same problems, and it still disconnect and reboot itself at random and frequently",firmware
"Its undeniable, this is the worst purchase I can remember making, I have flashed firmware (so many times now its a joke), done resets, combed the internet for help and can only conclude that this is a seriously under engineered time waster, sorry, after 10 months, I have had my fill",firmware
"It no longer runs Linux, and can no longer be upgraded with 3rd party linux software (technically firmware)",firmware
"In the meantime I had some minor, yet annoying issues, with external USB drives not waking up after going to sleep -- later firmwares fixed this",firmware
"<p>Firmware: The unit that I got hung almost every day, till I flashed it with the latest firmware from Linksys",firmware
"It took me a whole day to realize that it was impossible with this router (version 4, latest firmware 1",firmware
"The same problem happened in earlier hardware and firmware versions before (saw some online discussion), and it came back again in this latest version",firmware
"Thoughout the year, I've upgraded the firmware on the router several times, each time adding new functionality (PPPoE, IPSec tunneling, etc) without introducing any problems",firmware
"The rep had me download the same version firmware I was already running and had me reupload the firmware, then do a factory reset",firmware
A new version of the firmware was released yesterday and the problem is still not resolved,firmware
You can download a firmware upgrade,firmware
Up to this date I could not find a firmware version that works properly,firmware
"The web site actually warns against downloading the latest firmware ""unless you really need a feature in it"" The attitude of technical support is revolting",firmware
I updated the firmware (keep on top of firmware updates) and this problem went away,firmware
Updating the firmware is very very easy,firmware
Checked the website for firmware updates (in case I missed one that fixes something),firmware
nope I had the latest firmware,firmware
#NAME?,firmware
Also one big topic is the firmware,firmware
"Those issues are well known by Netgear but they can't issue a new and robust firmware, instead they keep change the name of the router",firmware
No recent firmware release to correct the issues,firmware
(Not sure why they didn't just push the new firmware onto the units when they were manufacturered,firmware
) Upgraded the firmware to the latest version and it's been working great the last week now,firmware
I was very happy with it until recently and now I'm going to have to play with settings to try and figure out if it is a firmware configuration  problem or if the hardware is just bad,firmware
"""Word"" is that the bugs in the firmware have NOT been worked out as of recently, and the router is very unstable to say the least",firmware
Even after upgrading to the newest firmware (1,firmware
In fact I never got it to work so I thought I might need a firmware upgrade,firmware
Somehow I got linked to the BEFW11S4 v2/3 firmware upgrade page and did not notice,firmware
"In my own erroneous fashion I went ahead and installed the wrong firmware, and what is worse is the software has no versioning checking! [went, installed, is, is, has, versioning] [own, erroneous, wrong, worse]
",firmware
"Be careful when dealing with linksys, I hope you don't get burnt doing firmware upgrades",firmware
My old unit had removable external antennas and plenty of RAM to support lots of traffic and advanced firmware like DD-WRT,firmware
It is underpowered and can only support the WW-DRT micro firmware,firmware
I then made sure the latest firmware was on the router and then that's where the problems materialized,firmware
"If you visit lniksys's site and read their forums you'll see lots of dialogue on frustrated users being told to upgrade firmware, etc,etc, and still getting no results",firmware
"I called tech support and after several failed attempts to upgrade the router firmware with level 1 and level 2 assistance, I was told my router's firmware (the original v1",firmware
The support tech tried various fixes including firmware and other undocumented tweeks,firmware
"32NA firmware already installed, so I was prepared for some of the problems that have been reported,  but so far, so good",firmware
"I've had to wait through two revisions of the firmware, about 6 months, to get even decent performance",firmware
I have the latest firmware but the problem persist,firmware
Then I decided to upgrade the firmware in it to try and fix a few problems,firmware
I am really hoping a third-party firmware comes out soon that works on this router,firmware
Then I found out all I had to do was update my router firmware and everything would have worked just fine,firmware
"All the tech person had to do to help me was to say ""Have you updated your firmware? [had, do, help, was, say, Have, updated] [tech]
",firmware
tried the normal trouble shooting methods of firmware upgrades and turning off wireless security to no avail,firmware
Make sure you have a compatible router or access point with up-to-date firmware,firmware
I am ready to give up after trying to fix this problem by flashing latest firmware and resetting router(30-30-30) several times,firmware
"You mean, I'm supposed to plug-in my old router firstly, pop the install CD in, maybe download a firmware update or something? [mean, 'm, supposed, pop, install, download, update] [plug-in, old, firmware]
",firmware
"Once I got past that, I was frustrated with doing some initial configuration just enough to connect to the Internet, download a firmware update file, flash the router, then start all over from scratch again",firmware
"I think I may have caused my problems by upgrading to the latest version of the firmware, which is v1",firmware
"21 firmware, one that has SecureSpot, and one that doesn't (stupid! [has, does] [stupid]
",firmware
"21 (which, I know, doesn't make sense), and the out-of-box version is the firmware WITHOUT SecureSpot",firmware
Should you choose to buy this router for WIN2K and you don't want to shell out another $20-$40 for a third party WLAN client then make sure if you do the firmware upgrade get the driver update for the NIC card as well AND stick with WEP encryption only (not like you have a choice),firmware
"Yes, I have the newest firmware (I've even reflashed it several times, just in case)",firmware
Those earlier routers run a flexible and powerful Linux based firmware that has been perfected for the past few years a numerous updates and tweaks,firmware
"Instead of the flexible, reliable and powerful Linux firmware the new WRT54G version 5 routers run the licensed VxWorks firmware instead",firmware
The open source Linux firmware with the large amount of flash and system memory was attractive to many third party independent software developers that were turning the WRT54G and GS routers into powerhouse micro Linux wireless computers with a functionality approaching and often surpassing the $600+ wireless routers that Cisco sells,firmware
"There might also have been an excess number of product warranty returns for the WRT54G routers due to so many people flashing them with non-Linksys third party firmware that sometimes can ""brick"" a router or make it unusable",firmware
"Your solution is to either look for a previous version of the ""WRT54G"" router before version 5 or purchase the ""WRT54GS"" (SpeedBooster) version 4 which as of the posting of this review is still available in the stores and it still uses the popular Linux firmware",firmware
If you want to use third party firmware you may want the GS versions 2,firmware
"Finally, if you do plan to flash your WRT54G with third party firmware the  ones before version 4 of the WRT54G wireless routers are supposed to be easier to work with",firmware
1) are the most flexible for use with third party firmware,firmware
Unless you want to use a more risky third party firmware I recommend that you read the manual instructions on how to carefully flash these older router models with a newer Linksys firmware which is designed for that specific router version,firmware
The latest official Linksys firmware for each specific version of router can be obtained from the Linksys support site,firmware
"You will see the ""CGN6"" serial numbers on the box and as of this review these were still using Linux firmware with software based SpeedBoost enhancements but the RAM and hardware inside seems to be essentially the same as the older WRT54G (v4",firmware
0 (CGN5) are also good and will have more flash RAM available if you want use the wireless router with third party firmware,firmware
"I would like to note that flashing the router with firmware other than an official Linksys releases obtained from the Linksys support web site will void the warranty and can result in a ""bricked"" or damaged router",firmware
Previous versions could be flashed with powerful third party firmware,firmware
0 routers can still be purchased and except for the SpeedBoost software enhancement (including a different version of Linux based firmware) they are essentially the same as older WRT54G v4,firmware
) CONCLUSION: With all the changes to the memory and the firmware this latest G model is really a very different product and Cisco should have changed the model number altogether,firmware
"Older firmware does not have this problem, so a newly installed router may not",firmware
"Now it turns out that I was shipped the V5 version of this router which has been modified to NOT run this popular, powerful, inexpensive firmware",firmware
"I can't imagine what motive Linksys had for this, since they don't get revenue from their own firmware",firmware
I've upgraded and downgraded firmware trying to find something that was really solid and reliable,firmware
Note these issues exist even as of the latest firmware at the time of this review (v4,firmware
"I was told that the firmware that was installed with initial setup is flawed and the additional ""support"" that's been put out is also flawed, so it was removed from the company website",firmware
"I owned this router for 9 months, works perfectly once I tried and error to different version of firmware and connection is speedy, steady and no drop signal",firmware
"I declared no firmware changed, nothing was changed, but dropped signal strength in a sudden",firmware
"I tried to upgraded and downgrade a few firmware, nothing improve to the signal strength",firmware
"If they said firmware, it is still belongs to Netgear support, they can suggest me to search the answer from the forum, but they did not, the only option is to pay for software support, it is completely insane",firmware
"I have tried updating the firmware, reverting to old firmware and everything in between",firmware
#NAME?,firmware
"However, after downloading the latest firmware from the Linksys web site (the 1",firmware
I've given the product 3 stars because of how easy it is to set up and because it works as advertised with the firmware upgrade,firmware
If Linksys can get the firmware issue straightened out the product would easily get 5 stars,firmware
"<p>The unit I purchased had fairly new firmware installed, so I haven't had to wrestle with doing a firmware upgrade",firmware
"I have been through multiple firmware and software upgrades, multiple support calls, and too many hours on-line trying to find solutions",firmware
"As far as I've read, it's one of the most reliable Wireless N routers out there, but is plagued with issues - most of which I hope will be fixed in upcoming firmware releases by D-Link",firmware
"After installing the latest firmware, this router worked for 2 weeks before my remote extensions all went dead on me (failed to come through the router and register), while internet connection (both LAN & WLAN) was still intact",firmware
"Pros (they don't outweigh the cons, but here they are): Gigabit ethernet works well for the home network Range is great along with speeds Firmware has lots of great tweaks if you are technically inclined Looks slick Cons: Sporadically quits working with the internet connection (home network stays up), confirmed this is not an ISP or modem issue D-Link support (even the manual and website are incorrect at times) Must update firmware to get it to even work at an aggravatingly livable level To start off, I have had a horrible experience with this product",firmware
Completely reflashed the firmware recently as a possible fix for the connectivity issues mentioned below,firmware
"It actually used to happen more when I first got the unit (I incorrectly thought it was the ISP at fault at the time), but the first firmware update in February 2010 got it up to a more stable state",firmware
"However, the level of reliability is still far from acceptable (even after a subsequent firmware update)",firmware
"One other HUGE issue, upon updating the firmware recently, they have a new thing called SecureSpot 2",firmware
I will update this review when I get new firmware that fixes this issue,firmware
"For all you firmware folks, the v3 model of the WNDR3700 is not supported by CeroWrt ([",firmware
Actually it is the second version with new firmware packed in new blue box while the first one is in orange box,firmware
"<p>Don't forget if you flash upgrade your firmware,  ALL of your router settings WILL BE LOST and you have to configure it all  over again",firmware
"I've updated firmware, followed all tech support steps, tried new cables, tried computers other than my own and in the end, it's the router that is malfunctioning",firmware
"Be aware that in order to connect your airport express via Linksys you will need to upgrade your firmware, and be ready to spend some serious time working with this project",firmware
This product will NOT do the following: Hold a connection with the settings of 1) not broadcasting ssid 2) wpa or wpa2 encryption 3) MAC filtering on wifi 4) connected to an uptodate Macbook via correct settings 5) all this with the last two firmware updates,firmware
Netgear should have left well enough alone with firmware v1,firmware
UPDATE 2011/11/15: Smallnetbuilder dot com stuck with firmware version v1,firmware
"The rationale behind the paranoid flash procedure is to make sure that another firmware version's setup (usually a slightly different size when backup-stored, with slightly different options) doesn't corrupt the the new firmware footprint (I guess)",firmware
I tried at least three versions of firmware and continued to have the same problem (1,firmware
"The internet is filled with similar complaints about slow downs and freezes, trying various firmwares, and doing various magic spell rituals before upgrading (holding reset button for 10 seconds, or 30 seconds, or doing it twice, unplugging with reset pushed, and so on)",firmware
This occurred even after upgrading the router to the latest firmware,firmware
Seems like problems kicked in after firmware upgrade v1,firmware
"Hours of frustrating calls to customer service, 2 replacements, and several firmware upgrades later, I gave up and decided to use only the wired switch",firmware
"I reset the router, upgraded the firmware, performed a clean upgrade of all operating systems, and did a little resurrection dance around the unit",firmware
"Changing the firmware, using a new password, restoring factory default",firmware
The router worked initially - until I applied the firmware update from Netgear,firmware
"Then, after applying the firmware update for the router, I got no response from it - wired or wireless",firmware
I daren't upgrade the firmware again in fear of rendering the router worthless - not that it's worth a whole lot now,firmware
Both the one at my home office and the one at our business office have done the same thing -- simply stopped being able to connect to the internet after a couple of months even though the signal strength was great -- and they only worked for a few days after the firmware download that the tech support people walk you through (or that you can do for yourself),firmware
"This is the second expander I have purchased, both of which had the same firmware revision",firmware
"If you already have the BEFW11S4 and are having problems, you could wait for a firmware upgrade--who knows when that might come out",firmware
"I have tried the hard reset, software reset and upgraded firmware, with no success",firmware
"Despite the fact that Linksys (owned by Cisco) has had firmware updates for its WRT54G router to support WPA2 since at least August 2005, it still has not bothered to update this product",firmware
Linksys has done the wireless community a great disservice by making it incompatible with third-party firmware that has more functionality than Linksys's own proprietary firmware,firmware
"The extra price is worth it, though, since the third-party firmware lets you increase the gain on the antennas and turn your routers into gateways, among other nifty features",firmware
"All-in-all, the WRT54G is a good starter model for those who don't want to mod, but the extra $15 for the WRT54GL would be worth it for anyone who plans on a true firmware upgrade",firmware
"I haven't tried customer support--not sure it's worth it, last time I had a similar issue took forever for them to tell me to reset the router, update the firmware--and still had the same issues",firmware
"Then if you want, you can flash the firmware to a much better third-party like DD-WRT",firmware
<p>I finally ended up getting everything to work by installing the latest firmware upgrade,firmware
SLOW: This has become slower and slower with updates (maps and firmware),firmware
I put the latest firmware on it,firmware
"However, I couldn't get WEP encryption to work at all until I upgraded the firmware, driver and ACU for the Cisco card past my apparently outmoded (6 point something) firmware version",firmware
"<p>Cisco has good instructions on its Website for downloading and installing the updated firmware, drivers, and ACUs",firmware
"<p>There are reported instances of data corruption during upload and download, even with the newest (or even newer) firmware",firmware
During this time I've been hoping that the connectivity issues would be resolved with the next release of the firmware for the router or driver for the laptop,firmware
I even liked how you could secure it with the latest encryption (after a firmware update) and even block out objectionable websites,firmware
"I contacted customer support, tried everything including resets, and going through every Netgear router firmware available",firmware
"However, this firmware version is explicitly called a beta release and is not supported by the company",firmware
<p>My advice: don't buy this until a new firmware is officially released *and* you start seeing consistently positive reviews of this product,firmware
"All previous versions ran Linux and were known for their high quality and reliability, as well as the ability to use upgraded firmwares",firmware
"WRT54G can't work   In above issue, I think maybe I can solve the problem by upgrading firmware",firmware
"Hence, I download the latest version firmware (wrt54g_1412",firmware
"I upgraded firmware twice, changed ip address, release/renew etc",firmware
I updated the firmware to the latest available with no luck,firmware
Downloading the most recent firmware update made it even worse,firmware
"They tried everything including a firmware upgrade, and a disabling of most protocols that had worked for 5+ years with my old dependable Linksys BEFSR41 Router",firmware
I was trying to use this device as a simple (albeit not in-expensive) way to extend the range of a Linksys WRT54G router running the DD-WRT firmware,firmware
"The Bad: The firmware is garbage, as a result this modem can not handle bittorrent traffic, multi-party video chat or any other kind of traffic that requires sending/receiving data from many different outside connections",firmware
"I asked all over the Linksys web site and talked to forum users and costumer service people alike, the final answer I got was that its related to the router firmware and until Linksys fixes it its gonna stay broke",firmware
"I did all the standard hoodoo garbage they recommend, tinkering with countless settings inside the firmware, holding the reset button and cycling power, cycling power multiple times after updating the firmware, rolling back to older revisions, etc",firmware
BEFW11S4 V4 needs a firmware update or a technical bulletin explaining what settings are needed to keep it working online,firmware
"Got it home, hooked up, updated the firmware and started to configure my port forwarding for my remote access but it turns out their port forwarding is pretty limited",firmware
I was reading another review stating that the frequent disconnects could be related to the latest firmware,firmware
First thing I did was update the firmware to the latest and greatest version,firmware
Maybe wait a few firmware patches or models before buying,firmware
After struggling with India support I had to download and burn from the web dd-wrt: an open source firmware for this router and i finally got it to work,firmware
Immediately out of the box there was a firmware update,firmware
Netgear support has confirmed this is a problem and said that it is releasing new firmware but can't confirm the date,firmware
I would not purchase until new firmware is released,firmware
The only advice from Linksys was to reflash the firmware for the router,firmware
"After several hours of very annoying questions that were designed for someone with no technical experience, they finally told me the router had a problem and asked me to reflash the firmware (basically means to reinstall it's operating system)",firmware
I did get a good price on them so I just wanted to know if there was some kind of defect that they weren't able to fix with a firmware upgrade and the only answer I got was the support person reading the text from the website,firmware
"I don't understand why, as it must be enough to just upgrade the kernel in the firmware, nothing more complicated than that",firmware
Finally I went to the Linksys website and discovered that I did not have the latest firmware,firmware
I updated the firmware and it now works great,firmware
"I reviewed my network device environment, router setup, firmware level and my problem",firmware
"I called Support again and got new settings to try and was informed of yet another firmware upgrade to download and install manually, which apparently the N600 didn't know existed",firmware
"10 firmware, and called Support one last time where I got a guy with the thickest accent of all, and began to get frustrated when he started asking all of the same questions about my network set up and devices (I have a case #",firmware
"He asked further, detailed questions leading us to reflash the firmware which also did not fix the problem",firmware
"<p>Linksys has a firmware upgrade - and even after  applying the thing, I still have connection refused issues and corrupt  downloads that mysteriously go away when I take the router out of the  picture",firmware
"11g v2 did not have a reliability issue with heavy p2p, but with fair amount of traffic its web interface did not respond at all; it was with firmware version 2",firmware
"1 with latest firmware(jan 20, 2004)<p>my other routers are linksys wrt54g v1",firmware
A later firmware upgrade cured that problem,firmware
"Seeing that there was a Nov 05 firmware upgrade available, I upgraded the firmware",firmware
Now the WRE54G refuses to associate with the WRT54G Access Point (which has the latest firmware),firmware
"So, you have to go to their website and get the new firmware but messenger voice/transfer would not work after that",firmware
"Then, after calling support (to India of all places) and trying to communicate with them in english of all things, they claim the firmware needs to be re-installed and the router needs to be re-set which erases everything and you have to start over",firmware
"After 30 minutes of that, the new firmware did not let those features work as before",firmware
Keep in mind this I flashed it with the most recent firmware and it still functioned the same,firmware
v5 cannot use third party firmware,firmware
"Since v4 is based on Linux, you can use third party firmware to unlock more advance features if you so desire",firmware
"After about twelve hours of struggle to get it working consistently, the power light began to blink, it stopped working and the only suggestion from Linksys was to upgrade the firmware",firmware
"To be fair, I have the older v1 of this router (there are at least 6 versions of this router, newer versions are labeled WGR614v2, WGR614v3 and so on), for which the only firmware update is labeled as beta",firmware
I had to get off the phone but about an hour later got the firmware and was finally able to see the extender as an available network,firmware
All of my computers are newer and have updated firmware,firmware
"I tried numerous times to download  their firmware, but each time I tried to unzip it I either got an error  telling me the file was corrupt, or it would generate an illegal  operation",firmware
"Got it all set up, current firmware and all",firmware
"After having no problems for about 6months, I upgraded router's firmware to the latest firmware (1",firmware
"After going through the Netgear forums and finding the same firmware problem was happening to several owners of the same router, I backed out of the upgrade and installed the prior version (1",firmware
"), he said that was all he could do unless I paid $60 for a software/firmware support contract because the software is only convered for 6 months after you purchase the router",firmware
There has been no official response from Linksys on this issue and there has not been a firmware update for about a year now,firmware
"After exchanging 4 of these at different locations and using the latest firmware, I have to conclude that it appears to be a limitation of the device",firmware
<p>I ended up performing a firmware upgrade and re-configuring the router,firmware
"I had some inkling that this might be the case, as it's documented on the Xbox Live web site, but I was holding out hope that the more recent firmware releases may have fixed it",firmware
"<p>Well, there's always hope for the next firmware release",firmware
"I heard a few beta firmware upgrades can cure this problem, but I haven't tried any out yet since it's still a beta",firmware
I searched Linksys forums and the Linksys website and found a firmware upgrade that specifically addressed my problem,firmware
"I explained my situation and after turning several pages of his manual and repeating things I had already tried (I was VERY cooperative and friendly), the agent had the nerve to tell me that the reason the router failed was because when I upgraded the firmware, I skipped a level (went from ver 2 to ver 4)",firmware
I'm going to do a firmware upgrade,firmware
The older firmware revisions did not have this problem,firmware
"However, only the latest firmware revision correctly supports UPnP (a very usefull feature for file-sharing software)",firmware
Linksys has not come out with a any new firmware version since middle of 2005 which really goes to show their commitment to customer support,firmware
"<p>To make a long story short, after eight nights of trying after work, and about forty tech support calls to Linksys and my ISP, after downloading the firmware update, I couldn't get my router to connect with my modem (by DirecTV)",firmware
"I had been very satisfied with my DIR 655 for 1 year, until I upgraded the firmware to 1",firmware
I gave 3-star to D-LINK for their horrible way to abuse firmware upgrading,firmware
I upgraded the firmware to the latest and it made no difference,firmware
I'm hoping a future firmware version will clear up these issues,firmware

There hasn't been any firmware upgrade to handle this shortcoming,firmware
I updated the firmware to the newest 1,firmware
"Finally, after an hour of work, the rep said that I would have to upgrade the firmware and she would transfer me to the senior tech support rep",firmware
"We know that it's published that it works with encryption but this is a known issue and we'll have new firmware out soon""  WHAT! [know, 's, published, works, is, have] [known, new]
",firmware
"I said that if they hadn't gotten firmware released in the 6 months since the product came out I wasn't sure that ""soon"" would arrive very quickly",firmware
I purchased a Linksys WRT54G router and loaded third party Sveasoft firmware onto it (available at www,firmware
"In my original plans, I thought I'd have to pay $99 for the Linksys Wireless Range Expander and another $100 or so for a wireless Ethernet bridge but by going with the WRT54G router w/Sveasoft firmware, it only cost me only $49 (router) and $20 (Sveasoft)",firmware
"It's been a rock solid connection with my main router, dramatically increased my wireless range, given me usable Ethernet ports without any additional wiring, and I can still use the subscription URL/parental control service from Linksys since my main router has original Linksys firmware",firmware
v5 includes a major firmware change that makes it not possible to update the firmware with 3rd party firmware,firmware
"I bought and returned this item, after spending most of an afternoon first getting it to partially work, then finding it didn't do what I needed, then finally finding I could probably have gotten it to do what I wanted, if only it was a v4, which allows 3rd party firmware",firmware
"A firmware update helped, but the attached device list continued to be missing an entry or two (again including the computer from which I was accessing the router's html interface)",firmware
After I ordered the WRT54G I read that Linksys modified it so that it has less memory and no longer runs Linux as its OS so you can no longer update the firmware,firmware
"You may browse for help on Linksys website and try to guess the solutions or follow procedures such as ""upgrade the firmware of your router"" and check your access points",firmware
"As if that were not enough already, trying to upgrade a firmware for a router is compllicated and troublesome",firmware
"Running up and down their website, it may be possible that I have to ""update the firmware"" of the Range expander, doing direct conections with a LAN cable between the computer and the antenna",firmware
"After 5 hours of router swapping, wire swapping, firmware updates and rollbacks, AC adapter tests, various browser tests, cmd prompt tests, I have come to the conclusion that all of my network problems start and end with the Linksys BEFSR41",firmware
In my opinion this gps -at least with current firmware- is disappointing when used for navigation,firmware
"This problem should be corrected by a new firmware update (is Garmin hearing? [be, corrected, update, is] [new]
",firmware
"Even tech support had me try firmware for the ""G"" version without success",firmware
"I read reports of a European firmware update that resolved the problem for some, but it didn't for me",firmware
I have tried at least three firmware updates and still crashes,firmware
"order wrt54gl instead ('L' means, it's running on linux, and could be easily upgraded to more stable open firmware in replacement of original default junk stored inside)",firmware
"Also, if you have disabled the SSID broadcast at your access point, the range finder auto-configure will not work nor will you be able to get into the firmware to set it up manually",firmware
I couldn't get the wireless connection to work at all until I downloaded the firmware update of 1/29/03,firmware
I had to download and install the latest firmware before it would start talking,firmware
"This is a direct result of the firmware, which really is pure junk",firmware
"The admin functions are accessed via a web page internal to the router and really is quite nice, except that the firmware is buggy",firmware
Update: I was able to get a beta version of the firmware from their tech support after complaining about the bugs and this version works great,firmware
I have to wait 1 week to see if the new firmware will work,firmware
<p>**UPDATE** The firmware upgrade on the web site worked great,firmware
"This unit is obviously in beta, they released it too soon -- and I have the May 30 release of the firmware (they released, then retracted a newer version that had more problems)",firmware
"<p>For those of you stuck with one, hover at the Linksys site for new firmware, which I imagine will eventually works the kinks out",firmware
"After I had this problem and my wireless internet stopped working, I tried upgrading the firmware to DD-WRT but that made it worse so I tried changing the firmware back to the latest linksys build but it still won't broadcast the internet",firmware
"I tried downloading and installing the latest firmware, and that didn't work either",firmware
It's worth noting that I have attempted to update the firmware but I have the latest version already,firmware
"I downloaded the latest firmware update, V1",firmware
It sounds like YOU want to help but the rest of your team is lacking in communication and designing the right firmware,firmware
I've done firmware upgrades and all kinds of tinkering with the settings based on endless internet searching,firmware
<p>I called their tech support and the only thing they could offer was to upgrade the firmware,firmware
In practice (probably because Linksys wants to force you to buy more of their products) it will work only with the latest firmware updates on their flagship WRT54G products,firmware
"Linksys did release a new firmware version on December 9, 2005",firmware
"If you want to download the new firmware version, go to www",firmware
It is a zipped file so you will need to unzip it before you can update the firmware,firmware
"I installed new firmware versions, one by one, on the router and kept trying",firmware
Tried beta firmware versions which were supposed to fix the problem,firmware
"The firmware update provided by Linksys fixes most of the problems, but I still see problems loading certain webpages",firmware
It's not worth your time waiting for better firmware,firmware
"As others have mentioned, this version does not allow you to load custom third party firmware",firmware
"The person on the phone went over basic solutions ( resetting, unplugging, firmware ) All useless as I thought and my lost $35",firmware
Linksys has lowered the built in RAM on this router in newer versions and it will not run full versions of most open source firmware (like Tomato or DDR),firmware
"""  A firmware update later and a reconfigure, things seemed to be back to normal",firmware
"I called tech support, they're completely aware of it and they provided me with one firmware update after another",firmware
It appeared that these firmware updates where buddy drops and that they where handed off to tech support so that the customers can do the testing,firmware
"Tech support gave some suggestions - firmware update, change MTU, and hard reset",firmware
"EDIT, 1-31-2012: After a tip from a buddy of mine with an older-version of this router, I did, in the end, on the most recent firmware, (V1",firmware

This is a known bug in a lot of router software and I am upset that a firmware fix is still not available,firmware
"As usual, there are plenty of bugs and undocumented features in the firmware",firmware
I've been using this product for about 6 months and was relatively happy until I upgrade my firmware per recommendation on the Linksys web site,firmware
After 3 more chat sessions and no result I finally got a call back from a senior tech who had me upgrade the firmware,firmware
"Hopefully, future firmwares will make the router more stable, but the last firmware update was 4 months ago from Linksys",firmware
After contacting tech support (not much help on this) I upgraded the firmware,firmware
"I have tried all means to get this work(firmware updates, re-installing the router many times, all the options available in the internet) but no luck",firmware
"I have updated the firmware several times where Linksys tech reviews for those updates were mentioning that ""some users"" had similar problems and those problems should be fixed in the new firmware update",firmware
I even have the latest version 3 firmware,firmware
All three promised that they will e-mail me an updated firmware as the latest version available on Linksys web-site still has bugs,firmware
After the corruption there's no reliable way to recover from it because firmware upgrade may not work anymore,firmware
I am not sure how their firmware (not hardware) can run into problem and why they don't have a good solution,firmware
"After an hour on the phone with Netgear, they advised me to do a firmware upgrade (uploading new software into the unit) despite the fact that I had just bought it",firmware
"I use a Mac, and the firmware upgrades only work using a PC (since I use Virtual PC, I was able to perform updates)",firmware
"I had a lengthy call with tech support where they had me upgrade the firmware, change settings, do hard resets, to no avail",firmware
"seemed to have a lot of adjustment options in firmware, but not as nicely organized or easy to understand as the Linksys admin page",firmware
"I recommend that if you buy this product, you download the latest firmware upgrade located in the linksys website",firmware
Do not buy this new version 5 if you ever want to upgrade the firmware with 3rd party enhancements,firmware
I purchased a net gear router N600 and have been researching how to do a firmware update,firmware
I thought it was compatibility issues with the my hard drive so I did some digging and found out that net gear knows about this problem and has not been able to solve the issue with a simple firmware upgrade,firmware
I have the latest firmware,firmware
"Note, however, that once you upgrade the firmware (which is really easy to do on the Linksys website), it works great",firmware
"At this point, with the extender still hard wired to your router, it is a good idea to update the extender's firmware",firmware
There are major flaws with this product and contrary to the advice of Netgear a firmware upgrade will not help,firmware

In fact new firmwares have actually introduced new problems so this router is just not worth the trouble,firmware
"Tried multiple resets, firmware upgrades, etc",firmware
I call back and they said a new firmware came out that was supposed to fix this very problem,firmware
I have updated the firmware and still have the same problems,firmware

"And the best part about it is that adding securespot required a firmware upgrade, which guess what, is not reversible! [is, adding, required, guess, is] [best, firmware, reversible]
",firmware
"In my case, I thought it was a simple case of firmware version incompatibility",firmware
"However, I did not find the firmware change to be necessary with this router",firmware
I bought the WNDR3700 to replace an old but reliable WRT54G running dd-wrt firmware,firmware
"Netgear provided a beta firmware which solved this problem, but it didn't fix any of the other problems",firmware
"I did not try new firmware, because people report all sorts of problems flashing the unit",firmware
"However, after downloading the latest firmware from the Linksys web site (the 1",firmware
I've given the product 3 stars because of how easy it is to set up and because it works as advertised with the firmware upgrade,firmware
If Linksys can get the firmware issue straightened out the product would easily get 5 stars,firmware
Then I upgraded the router's firmware to its latest version; that didn't help either,firmware
The firmware is the latest 2,firmware
Then I installed the latest firmware (released 01-Jul-2003) and it has been working perfectly,firmware
"But read the release notes with the latest firmware: ""This release is only for beta testing",firmware
"<p>I would avoid this product until Linksys releases non-Beta firmware (and the firmware works, based on user reviews), and then I would buy it only if you are adept at firmware upgrades",firmware
"I have a v3 version, and I upgraded the firmware",firmware
They shipped a fix somewhat later but the firmware update left my router in an unusable state,firmware
"So, I saw that there was a firmware upgrade",firmware
") all they could suggest was manually configuring all of the computers behind the router to use static routes to the name servers (which I wasn't willing to do, and, in a simple test failed to fix the problem), or upgrade the firmware to a beta release, version 1",firmware
"I thought, ""maybe after one year I should get a map update or a firmware update",firmware
It drops my VPN connection if I idle for 4 minutes and even the latest firmware (1,firmware
"I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that, tweaking the connection software, upgrading firmware, blah blah blah, but honestly, how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running",firmware
"When I fire up uTorrent, my mIRC connection drops, and my web connection drops to about 300kbps dl speed;  after much frustration, and even a firmware upgrade, I have decided to give up on trying to make it work",firmware
I may not be the most network savvy guy but I program device drivers for a living and this device has just been one big headache trying to get it to work right with constant firmware upgrades,firmware
though latest firmware seems to work better,firmware
"After a week of fiddling, downloading firmware (for this item, the new PC card WPC54GS as well as the router WRT54GS), endless resetting, then paying an experienced consultant to try to get the thing to work, I gave up and returned the junk",firmware
"I have a Wireless-G Linksys Access Point (WRT54G), that works wonderfully, that I wanted to use with this Linksys Extender - the Extender never did work in spite of having no security, and all the latest firmware",firmware
Among the things I had to do was install new firmware and a new version of the print server software,firmware
"Their tech support will only give you the next revision of the firmware if its available, which they sware will fix it but never does",firmware
I've heard that the firmware may be the problem so if you do end up buying this you better not update the firmware because once you do you cannot go back to the older version,firmware
"After researching Linksys deeper, I found the WRT54G now has a different firmware (VxWorks) and has decreased the amount of RAM",firmware
"(As a matter of fact, WNDRMac is much closer to WNDR3800, only missing things are the firmware features like ClearChannel Selector, Tivo compatability etc)",firmware
"If you do have interest, make sure that your firmware of choice has support for this newer version (FCC ID is PY308300092)",firmware
"However, after upgrading to the latest firmware, to comply with the 802",firmware
"<p>We use three wireless components at the house, and none of them could hold a signal once I installed the new firmware",firmware
I just downgraded the firmware and was able to get the router back to the performance it had before,firmware
I noticed after a lot of hair pulling that others are waiting on dd-wrt firmware to rectify this VPN issue,firmware
UPDATE 9/10/2010 : Somehow during a firmware update VPN is now working in Windows 7 64bit,firmware
"I did everything he said, including upgrading the firmware, and Outlook still wouldn't send large messages",firmware
"Once I updated the firmware the wireless speed DOUBLED! [updated, DOUBLED] [wireless]
",firmware
Given the shoddy quality of the firmware maybe making this feature a little more useful was just beyond their ability,firmware
This is how the unit works AFTER several firmware updates,firmware
Con: - no firmware with WPA support to date - I am not able to achieve expected speeds downstream (upstream is fine) with a Broadcom 54G mini-PCI card - I am able to get full speed with the WG511 card in the other laptop Pro: - Range is great - Did not crash once on me - Wireless connection is 100% stable (I use VPN so that is fairly important for me),firmware
"So, I thought: ""let's get the latest firmware from the web""",firmware
"maybe about 6 to 10 hours crashed, anyone can send me the old European firmware",firmware
"It took me a whole day to realize that it was impossible with this router (version 4, latest firmware 1",firmware
"The same problem happened in earlier hardware and firmware versions before (saw some online discussion), and it came back again in this latest version",firmware
"Two weeks ago I decided to check for new firmware, and attempted to download the newest version from linksys's site",firmware
"Following directions on Linksys's webpage, I re-downloaded the firmware, and it actually got a little better",firmware
"Judging from what I've seen, alot of them do work just fine, so there seems to be more at play then just a firmware bug, which would affect all units",firmware
just make sure to upgrade to the latest firmware,firmware
"After a year of frustration with this unit I'm finally tossing it and getting an ASUS RT-N16 instead, which supports open source firmware and gets rave reviews for its stability (when loaded with the Tomato firmware)",firmware
The most obscure involved flashing up to a Russian Beta firmware version which then allows you to them flash down to 1,firmware
"21, which everyone hails as being the only stable firmware release",firmware
"WARNING -- Version three of this router (the newest, currently shipping/on the shelf version with firmware 1",firmware
As of this writing (9-10-03) there is no firmware upgrade fix available,firmware
"Only the original firmware version  from 6-20-03 is available, and you CAN NOT use the firmware for the  previous versions of this model with the version 3 model",firmware
You can go to the DIR-655 page on dlink forums and see thread after thread complaining about these issues for firmware 1,firmware
"One last thing to be aware of: If you are a fan of DD-WRT firmware, the DIR-655 is not supported",firmware
"Even after several updates to the firmware, the media server still hangs every few hours",firmware
"After the latest firmware update, at least the NAS works",firmware
"It also took days and many, many phone calls to tech support to get this to work including firmware upgrades to both, endless reconfiguring and trying different settings on both the router and expander",firmware
I did a firmware upgrade to no avail,firmware
Install disc is worthless (firmware 1,firmware
"Even with the newest firmware, this router drops the wireless at least once a day and has to be rebooted",firmware
"4) The firmware update mechanism repeatedly confirmed, that there's no newer firmware available",firmware
"With the help of this forum, I was able to get the device back by TFTP-ing the firmware by command line",firmware
"My search for an alternative firmware like Tomato wasn't successful, because the ingenious product designers removed 2 of the 4 megabyte RAM that is necessary for these firmwares",firmware
The Tech Support person had me download a firmware patch,firmware
The reason why we only would have given four stars is that they shipped it out without the requisite firmware,firmware
"My computer guru( #3 son) had to update the firmware a couple of times, the last time last night",firmware
The device automatically detected that there was a newer version of firmware available when it first booted up,firmware
"This time, I downgraded the firmware to the previous version hoping that would fix this problem",firmware
"Worked fine out of the box when being used as a wired router but it took a total of 4 hours on the phone with tech support, several firmware downloads/installations and more asprins than I care to admit to get this puppy working wirelessly",firmware
The unit has hardware v1 and the latest firmware,firmware
"It costs a bit more, but you'll find it has more memory and thus can support more features with new firmware",firmware
"No new firmware, and upon searching for answers, this is a huge problem with these units",firmware
"Also, if you your router is WRT54G and is v3, you will need to upgrade your firmware to at least 4",firmware
"They just now finally released a firmware that allowed more than 256k to flow through the router, the changelog for the firmware update states ""Resolves issues with slow downstream speeds""",firmware
"on hold, he said he couldn't do that because the firmware upgrade had been removed from Cisco's website due to ""legal reasons""",firmware
"Also tried to do a firmware update, but router was already running latest firmware",firmware
The DIR-655 started rebooting within a day of installation with the current firmware,firmware
I updated the firmware and still the same issue,firmware
I called them back and they walk me through the same set-up and firmware upgrades I've already done,firmware
"I have updated the firmware, turned off any options possible, read all the forum posts and made sure the thing is not overheating",firmware
I have updated it with the latest firmware version 3,firmware
UPDATE: I ended up purchasing the DIR-655 and I would give it 4 stars now because of their latest firmware updates,firmware
I used Linksys online chat to contact tech support and they recommended flashing with an older firmware,firmware
"I am afraid this particular item either needs a necessary firmware, which maybe an excuse from DLink or simply it is a defective router sold by this retail company",firmware
"Although it was packed in a box that appeared to be for the American market, the firmware inside displayed some Asian language (Korean? [was, packed, appeared, be, displayed] [American, Asian, Korean]
",firmware
Tried to download firmware from Linksys as I was unable to connect through the internet with it after asking the tech guys at Verizon about the problem and they say it's something about the router that is not working,firmware
"I tried to download the firmware, but it lead to a dead link",firmware
"However, the latest firmware updates have left a large number of users quite unhappy",firmware
Stability issues have arisen in the latest firmware releases that dlink seems either unable or unwilling to fix,firmware
"31, you can not go back to previous firmware versions",firmware
If you purchase a router and it has a firmware prior to 1,firmware
"31 firmware, I was quite happy",firmware
The final straw came when they told be to do a hard reset and reload the firmware,firmware
"It is totally inappropriate and negligent to sell a product that requires firmware downloads every couple of days to patch flaws and hours of sifting through arcane jargon and sitting on help lines to get running, and don't forget shipping on your own dime and trips to the post-office etc",firmware
I updated the DLINK to the latest EU firmware 1,firmware
"Conclusion: This would be a good router, but i think DLINK has a problem",firmware
"In my opinion, Netgear released this product, and it's latest firmware revision, before they were sufficiently tested",firmware
"I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that, tweaking the connection software, upgrading firmware, blah blah blah, but honestly, how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running",firmware
I decided to unhook the D-Link router and plug back in my old Buffalo router (with Tomato firmware),firmware
"And, as always, don't forget to update firmware on new unit before setting it up",firmware
) Because I couldn't get into the online menus I couldn't configure the extender so that it matched the encryption settings on my network nor could I upgrade the firmware,firmware
Some people download third party firmware that circumvents the signal strength limiter but I wasn't about to do anything that might void the warranty and thus my ability to return it,firmware
"Pros: this router has a significant advantage over the others - it has a mini-Linux running inside, and the firmware source code is available under GPL",firmware
Lots of folks asking when the new firmware will finally be released,firmware
Support forums also have lots of people regretting updating their firmware - the wretched thing just behaves worse and worse,firmware
My Tomtom Go720 is only 2 years old but Tomtom wants me to pay for a firmware AND map  update ($120) Well I just can't see spending that much when a brand new updated unit is only $200,firmware
LinkSys written specifications say this router supports IPSec passthrough (needed for access to some secure networks) but their firmware doesn't,firmware
"The latest firmware release for this router has the IPSec passthrough enable in the router menu but in exchange for this feature (apparently), the wireless network PC cards in my other computers became inoperable",firmware
So I had to chisel an older version of the firmware out of customer support just to get back to where I started,firmware
"Defaulted the router, updated the firmware - port forwarding completely stops working altogether",firmware
"Make no mistake about it, the J3's are beautiful, solid aluminum construction, awsome clear coat wire that does not tangle",wire
"Sound quality is good, they are attractive and the wire never get tangled",wire
I'm not a big fan of the glossy plastic cover over the entire wire either,wire
There is a clever plastic slider on the wire that makes adjusting these earphones easy if you run,wire
I had these headphones for about 2 weeks before one of the headphone acme apart and was only held together by the thin speaker wire,wire
Beside the fact that the wire from the one I purchased on ebay which are much beefier then jlab's ear buds,wire
I was at school on friday (6/4) and I went to take the earphones out of my ear when the speaker stayed in my ear and was still attached to the actual earphone by wire only,wire
"The cable is better than your standard plastic-coated headphone wire, and the earbud casings themselves are metal and should be able to take a beating",wire
Neutral: The wire are equal length (Y-style),wire
"I did what previous reviews stated, and played around with ear placement, and finding the best way to have them sit in my ears for the best sound, and during that process, the Left Bud basically split into two pieces, and the part that goes in your ear are now hanging by the two wire",wire
The wire on the original buds are supple and feel nice,wire
pretty much living be ready to listen to every movement and touch of the wire,wire
"I think this may have to do with the fact that the speaker housing, made of aluminum combined with the thicker, sturdy wire, kept trying to pull them out",wire
"The sound comes back on, but I have to keep my head, the wire, and the ipod perfectly still - any movement, and the right earphone cuts out again",wire
"About a week later, neither of the buds would work except if you moved around the wire near the audio jack",wire
After the wire in my Jbuds J2s started to malfunction after about five months(which is a remarkably long time for my earbuds to last)I thought I'd buy another pair,wire
"The good news is the connections and wire do appear to be more likely to resist wear and tear than the Maximo's, which is why I decided to switch",wire
"Any little hit, rub, tug or anything to the wire when in use seems to cause the sound to jump around",wire
The wired remote stopped working within a few weeks of purchase,wire
"It wasn't until last week when the speaker became loose of the encasing and just hangs by the wire, granted I did use the earbuds really heavily",wire
"Whatever the coating on the wire does to try and make it difficult to tangle (difficult, not impossible), it ends up conducting the sound of the friction quite loudly",wire
"And, last but not least, the rubber cord wrap where the wire and the plug meets is already showing signs of cracking -- which I'm sure is only an indicator of the overall build quality of these ""quality"" headphones",wire
"I accidentally broke my coby headphones that came with the mp3 player, and although you have to get the smallest ear-bud and stick it in your ear these have better sound quality and are louder than my coby headphones, for $10 these are good, not the $50 they originally were but If I needed another pair I'd buy again Update:6/11/2012 These are flimsy headphones and will not last long at all as they are already broken and have become trash and I do not recommend you get these headphones as they will not last long and will surely disappoint you, and you'd be better off getting headphones with thicker wire so they dont break so easily",wire
The two buds are widened by simply prying apart the two wire,wire
It's more like a wire than a normal headphone cord,wire
"Within a week or two, it had completely separated and was held together only by the internal wire but could be snapped back into place",wire
I think issues with ear buds tend to relate to the cord not being thick and sturdy enough to protect the wire within,wire
"Amazon had the black version for $40, free shipping, and I was about to order them when I found a 3rd-party seller on amazon (usedmarket24open) offering the S version (silver and black earpieces, but the wire are solid black) for $20 plus $5 shipping (<a href=""http://www",wire
"These J-buds are a cool design (I really like the sliding thing that lets you tighten the wire close to your chin), but to me they make the music sound dull",wire
"I used them for 2 months anyway, until the left ear bud lost it's sound (I think from a break in the internal wire)",wire
The wire coating is soft and they are light and comfortable to wear,wire
"One minute, I hear static until I move the wire around, then if I make the slightest move, the sound completely goes out in one of the buds, and I have to move the wire around again",wire
The sound is good however if the wire is touched or bumped you get major feedback,wire
The wire length is perfect,wire
"When I jiggled the wire, the earbud worked--but I had to hold the wire in place! [jiggled, worked, had, hold] [earbud]
",wire
"The quality of the wire is different than the original one I bought, so I think JLab is using cheaper materials now",wire
"But in January 2011, one of the buds' speakers fell out of the headphone portion, the only thing that holds it together is the speaker's wire, the speaker is dangling out",wire
"It is dead most of the time, unless i wiggle the wire just so to re-enable some presumably severed contact now",wire
"At first, if I wiggled the jack or held the wire a certain way, and remained perfectly still, it'd come back but only go out again",wire
There is a little cover over the wire where it attatches at the ipod and it's not welded or glued so it just pulled apart after a few times of taking it out of the ipod,wire
"(Also, the squishy part of the ear bud ripped) I pressed the dislocated part and wire back into the main casing, and it still plays noise, but I'm concerned at how flimsy they were",wire
"However, after almost a 18 months of usage, one of the buds went silent as apparently some of the smaller wire inside the casing leading to the jack became detached at the base of the plug",wire
So JLabs you get 2 stars because I am sure you tried to produce a good product and for the appealing packaging and aesthetic design of the ear-buds but minus 3 stars for the piece of wire junction that is midway between the ear-buds and the connection to  my ipod that keeps hitting my chest and leaving a dud sound every time I try to listen to music,wire
"When I get the time, I'll re-solider the wire back on and glue the pieces together, but it's hardly worth the hassle",wire
"Unless JLab has significantly improved the quality of the materials (the plug and wire), I would stay clear of these",wire
"From the look only, it seems like the internal wire that make up the headphones are encased in a metal or metal-like sheath and then surrounded by a rubber or silicone casing",wire
"In addition, the design of the wire splitter for left and right earbuds doesn't make sense; I'd have preferred a stationary splitter positioned closer to one ear to prevent the wire from getting in the way or needing to adjust the plastic splitter piece",wire
"It picked up too much exterior noise if the wire touch anything, it's very bad for running as it hits against your clothing",wire
"Now the bad, the major problem with them in general from my experience of the three cheapest models is that while the buds themselves are of solid quality and relatively strong wire they are put together in a obviously cheap and rushed manner",wire
Because of this the wire that are connected to the actual headphone jack are held in place with a single dab of glue,wire
"The wire leading to each bud are quite thin, which makes me think that this is a fragile product",wire
"The two things I like about the JLabs are the case, which I use for my Skullcandy's now, and the slick wire, which doesn't seem to become tangled like other ear buds",wire
"The in-ear part had fallen out of the base, but it was still attached by wire",wire
"One caveat:  don't be tempted to adjust the snugness of the ear bud wire under your chin, until you are sure about how far to adjust them",wire
"the wire are slick instead of the iPod's slightly grippy wire, which means they untangle easier",wire
The earpiece needed to be glue on the first day I had them because in changing the earplug the silver part popped off (no wire snapped luckily),wire
"I was thrilled with these - they fit great, sounded great (although didn't greatly reduce ambient sound) but after having them for only 3 days - one of the cords had 2 cracks in the black plastic through which I could see the silver wire underneath",wire
I thought they were going to be a good workout pair but the wire's location will constantly make noise as you move,wire
"The first impression when I got it was really good assembly quality and nice wire, however when I tried to use it impression changed immediately",wire
"The headphones sounded great, and the wire never got all tangled up",wire
The fit of the soft rubber plugs was good if the wire hangs straight down,wire
I found i could get the sound if I held them in the exact right position at all times--no letting the wire move,wire
"i love the color and the length of the wire, but the buds dont really fit my ear properly they end up falling out after a few minutes, and i dont think they are too comfy",wire
"There is no reason this should have happened, I am not rough with them, in fact, I've had two sets of Sony ear-buds, that still work, the ones I have don't have a long wire unless you use the adapter that is meant for the sony ericsson cell phones they came with",wire
less wire turning back and forth at the junction,wire
"I tell you, I have worn out many headphones and earbuds(many brands) and always it is where the jack is attached to the wire, so I guess that Jlabs is not really too different from anybody else in the cheap earbud market",wire
"However, that love was short lived when the silver housing of the wire harness on the right earbud would not stay secured within its housing",wire
"The product does have some strength, such as the quality of the wire, and the case that comes with it",wire
"Unfortunately, that results in the stick and wire coming out at a 90 degree angle to the head - quite funny looking, and not good at all if you want to put on hearing protection over them",wire
"Everyday i would unwrap the wire from around my ipod, place the ipod in my back pocket, and go to work (never sat on it)",wire
They died from what appeared to be a broken wire in the same place,wire
"if I hold the wire just right, the right side will work",wire
"When I wiggled the jack and held the wire a certain way, and remained still, it worked fine",wire
The wire are too long and get tangled,wire
Smooth coating on the wire reduces rubbing noises,wire
"My issue is that I DID NOT abuse these, and by all visual inspections they appear fine, but the right ear bud cuts out unless I hold the wire at a very specific angle, right at the jack",wire
You have to put the wire in a specific position to make it work,wire
"The J2s were so incredible because they eliminated the problem that plagues so many in-ear headphones - that sound you hear when the wire taps your desk, the treadmill, or anything else",wire
After two months the sound only comes out of one earbud unless you wiggle the wire the exact correct way and don't move it,wire
If you turn the music off completely and then just listens to the noise created by moving your head you will see what I mean -- it is especially bad when wearing a jacket as the cord/wires rub across the collar constantly,jack
5 mm jack housing is constructed at a 45degree angle different than typical L looking jack,jack
"Gold connector jack, Price Cons: Ear buds pop out extremely easily, muted sounds not much high treble or bass feeling,",jack
And it's not just my ipod - the headphones have the same problem when plugged into any headphone jack,jack
"About a week later, neither of the buds would work except if you moved around the wire near the audio jack",jack
"The gold coating on the input piece had chipped off, and you'd have to get it at just the right angle in the jack to hear out of both sides",jack
"They seem like fine earbuds, but the plug doesn't fit into the recessed 1st gen iphone jack, which is what I bought them for",jack
"Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then wires started to show so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds",jack
"Only way I can get the sound to work is by bending the cable above the jack slightly in one direction, but once I release the cable the sound cuts out once more on the right side",jack
This is a common problem with earbuds with a classic jack connection,jack
"I can get it to come on again if I hold the lead at a certain angle with respect to the jack, but it will cut out again and I have to find a new angle",jack
If you use earphones daily get more expensive ones with the hard plastic jack housing,jack
"It was possible to achieve intermittent activity when I took the cable and pressed it gently where it meets the neck of the jack, but I wasn't going to put up with that",jack
"5 mm headphone jack and I get shocked every time I use these earbuds, even if I don't touch anything; I tried using friends' earbuds, no shocking ensued",jack
The only advantage is the price and nice L-shaped connection jack,jack
Something else I didn't think about when I purchased these was the shape of audio jack--it's a elbow unlike the straight connection used by the Apple ear buds,jack
"I just wish they used the angled jack, those jack seem to hold up a lot better",jack
"This is a common problem for people that carry their headphones/ipod in their pockets constantly, so I'd be careful, and would instead get headphones with angled connecting jack like the new VModa's",jack
"Despite ""breaking in"" the buds magnets by leaving them attached to the stereo jack on my tuner for 24hr",jack
I would have thought JLab would have reinforced where the cable cord meets the audio jack,jack
5mm jack is very durable,jack
Because of this the wires that are connected to the actual headphone jack are held in place with a single dab of glue,jack
"Any minor tugging on the headphones from jogging, walking or what not the wires will discount from the jack section and eventually will kill the headphones",jack
) The mini jack is at a right angle which makes it a nice fit on the Sansa Clip,jack
"Not only is the sound quality different, but the earphone jack and cord are different which leads me to believe that I either received a knock-off version of this product or perhaps they changed the model slightly",jack
Straight-in jack - This is a ruined pair of ear phones waiting to happen,jack
"I use my mp3 player almost exclusively for exercising, and even though I use a clip to secure the headphone cord to my jacket or shirt (to eliminate the tendency of the cord to pull the buds out of my ears), I often find that the buds eventually start to get loose and I need to push them back in, or they get sweaty and I need to dry them off",jack
"This caused stress on the wiring near the end of the headphones (where they plug in to a jack), resulting in intermittent connections",jack
"I take really good care of my electronic products, wrapping headphones carefully and taking out the jack whenever I'm not using it but still these headphones break on me! [take, wrapping, taking, 'm, using, break] [good, electronic]
",jack
i think (have no proof) that angled connectors work better and last longer if your player has the jack port on the side,jack
"I tell you, I have worn out many headphones and earbuds(many brands) and always it is where the jack is attached to the wire, so I guess that Jlabs is not really too different from anybody else in the cheap earbud market",jack
"and if you pull the jack out a little ways, you can hear them fine",jack
"but if you are a runner or even walking with this jack out a little ways, it falls right out",jack
If I moved the cord around it would come in and out but it never stayed on consistently - flashback to when you try to get the sound for a movie in an airplane using your own headphones and you struggle trying to get the jack to go in just the right amount to get sound in both ears,jack
"When I wiggled the jack and held the wire a certain way, and remained still, it worked fine",jack
"I use these mostly for jogging, but do carry them wrapped around my Sansa Clip in my jeans pocket, and apparently this is too much for the non-reinforced portion at the back end of the pin jack",jack
"My issue is that I DID NOT abuse these, and by all visual inspections they appear fine, but the right ear bud cuts out unless I hold the wire at a very specific angle, right at the jack",jack
"
",jack
Second pain point is the shorter overall length of the cord - and honestly this comes down to personal preference I know,cord
"I do like the construction of the cord though, looks great and seems durable",cord
"No special instruction like this product requires ""twist headphone upside down to your ear canal and put the cord around your ears"" for when you exercise",cord
"These earphones come with a very rigid cord that I thought it was good and durable, but it does not bend too easy and when it rubs against your clothes you can hear it amplified",cord
"The cord is perfect, it doesn't get easily tangled and it's got a good sturdy feel to it",cord
At least it's not the funky cord style like the sony fontopias,cord
"within a week after that, the other headphone didn't work (unless I twisted the cord in just the right way)",cord
The cord length is 6-12 inches to short in my opinion,cord
"Worse than that, I had failed to take advantage of the warranty while I could and Amazon had no record of me even buying them, which made no sense",cord
"I also like the fact that the cord is a very nice size, and i like the Y-shape of the cord because it looks ""cooler"" in my opinion",cord
"Then with wear and tear, the right earbud started to go, and I would have to fight and twist the cord to get a half-second of sound",cord
"The cord was a good length, and there was some reduction in outside noise",cord
The Skullcandy cord is also a lot thicker and sturdier than the JBuds cord,cord
"If for some reason you don't want to pay an extra few dollars, though, the JBuds are good - just be really careful with the cord",cord
The ear buds are extremely prone to popping out of your ear canal if the cord is at all moved; which was not my case with the stock iPod ear buds,cord
"I had a bad habit of wrapping the cord around my MP3 player, so I'm not ready to blame JLab for that",cord
"I ordered new ones, because my warranty had run up and the new headphones wouldn't work properly unless I had the cord positioned just right in my mp3 player",cord
The company recomends looping the cord around the ears which is completely impossible,cord
"The first issue I have is that I am a tall man (6' 2"") and find the cord to be about 4 inches shorter than I would like it to be",cord
"As a few other reviewers have noted, I too encountered the problem where one of the buds (in my case, the left) stopped working after only a couple months of use (even though it would sometimes come on intermittently, if the cord was moved correctly, I don't think it should be considered ""working"" when you can't stick your iPod in your pocket while you're walking aroung and expect it to work consistently)",cord
"To be fair, there are a lot of variables involved in the durability rating that I have given: perhaps my pocket is a harsher environment that what was intended for these headphones; perhaps I unknowingly yanked the cord at some point",cord
"That is, if the cord touches something, there is an audible sound in the headphones that simply is not exhibited with most other headphones",cord
I bought a pair of the J2's last year and they were great until the cord got pulled out of one of the ear-pieces,cord
When I stretch them almost to the full extent that the cord is straight they intermittently send a shock to my ears,cord
The cord is especially nice - it seems to be Teflon-coated and is very soft with a bit of memory character,cord
A good fit and seal are very easy to achieve either cord-up or cord-down,cord
"Now the fatal flaw:  Even though the sound seems better than it was out of the box, if anything touches the cord even slightly along its entire length, the sound is amplified in the earphones",cord
The headset is worthless; you can hear every sound amplified when you touch the cord; it sounds like I'm wearing a stethoscope to listen to music; every breath I take touches the cord and I hear a rumble along the line; even cheap earphones that I buy from a street vendor for $5 don't do that,cord
The non tangle cord was great as well,cord
"However, after 3 days of occasional use with my laptop, the left earbud stopped working unless I wiggled the cord and held it just right",cord
"I've previously owned the standard Apple (good sound, but let in too much environmental noise), Sony (good sound & very comfortable, but the cord turned to mush w/in 2 months), and a cheap brand whose buds felt like they were made from a old tire",cord
"Good cord strain relief, and MUCH better comfort when laying down",cord
Even the cord is of much higher quality,cord
Pros: Looks good Good fit in ear Perfect cord length Mic works well Bass isn't bad Con: Treble is screweddddd (this con basically outweighs all the other pros for me),cord
"I listen to music very quietly though, so if you had the volume higher it would probably drown out the cord noise",cord
"There is no sliding cord-keeper piece, which helps to keep them untangled",cord
"The left speaker turns off and on randomly, and you have to twist and play with the cord to get the sound back",cord
"I do like that the cord doesn't tangle, the sound quality is good and the carrying case keeps everything clean and in order",cord
"The fit is comfortable for me, and the weight and cord have not been a problem",cord
"The bad news is the cord is about 6"" shorter than the unextended length of the Maximo's",cord
"The cord is of moderate length, but the earbuds just simply won't stay in when you're sweating and moving",cord
Edit: It was windy outside today and the noise it made by hitting the cord for these headphones was louder than the music I was listening to,cord
I was buying these to replace ear buds that had a shorter left ear cord than right ear cord with a 2ft cable extension for regular listening,cord
"After having that feature and using them all the time at the gym, I decided I couldn't live with this long cord in the JBuds and needed to return them",cord
I really just wanted a pair of earphones that when I walked/jogged I wouldn't get the annoying noise through the cord,cord
I had been searching for the best earphones I could get at a good price and have a long cord so I wouldn't have to worry about them always pulling out of my ears,cord
Ordered them and noticed the cord was longer and they fit even more perfectly,cord
So now back to square one with the horrible JBuds 3 that constantly fall out of my ear on top of the already short cord,cord
"And, last but not least, the rubber cord wrap where the wire and the plug meets is already showing signs of cracking -- which I'm sure is only an indicator of the overall build quality of these ""quality"" headphones",cord
"After a few weeks the left side went out, if i jiggled the cord it would sometimes phase back in, then the right side went out",cord
The metal finish and the cord and everything looks absolutely stunning,cord
It's more like a wire than a normal headphone cord,cord
"Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then wires started to show so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds",cord
"But with the J3Ms, I already know the track record might mean I don't even get a few months of sound out of one ear",cord
"Anyway, the little rubber things fall off too easy, and I have just had to replace them because the wire has a short in it right where the jack goes into the ipod, and sound only comes out of one side unless you hold the cord steady",cord
probably my sons fault because he wraps the cord around the ipod to put into his pocket and I'm sure they probably tell you not to do that,cord
"Bottom line is, for the money they are pretty good over all, but word to the wise, don't wrap the cord around your mp3 player if you can help it or they might not last too long",cord
"The cable is thick, the construction high quality, and the sound is like I'm sitting in the recording studio",cord
"When I first saw them, I was very pleased; the cord has a nice feel and the case is very convenient with the pouch that hold different earbud sizes",cord
"I've had many pairs of earbuds and do understand that the movement of the cord will be picked up by your ears when you're not listening to music, but this crinkling sound (I think from faulty manufacturing) drove me nuts and actually hurt my ears",cord
"I broke them in according to the instructions, using their website, which helped increase the sound quality of the headphones",cord
"CONS: Just get better headphones, they dont even stay in your ears if you give the cord a tug",cord
"The cord are surprisingly sturdy, and the all-metal body probably won't fall apart any time soon",cord
My complaint with these headphones probably comes down to the type of rubber/plastic used in the cord and the ear plugs,cord
The cord is very rigid almost plastic material and does not stay wrapped up on my arm-band,cord
"For the earbud issue, the cord, and minus the two buttons makes them inferior to the original iphone earbuds",cord
It's most noticeable when listening to something like Sting: the bass and treble are over-emphasized and Sting sounds like he's way at the back of the recording studio somewhere on an improperly-amped mic,cord
"An extra 10-15cm of cord would have fixed this problem, and I recommend that JLab fixes this, too",cord
"The Denons don't have as much bass but are much clearer, sound very smooth, and do not have as much cord noise",cord
"The cord on these ear buds was much, much thinner than the two I mentioned above",cord
I got them because the cord looked more durable and I got an amazing deal at a close-out sale ($1,cord
"The ear buds fit great, the sound was killer and the cord was the only one that did not disintegrate after using it for running for a few months",cord
I am not an exceptionally tall man so the cord length generally wasn't an issue unless I tried to keep it in a coat pocket,cord
It was a nice plastic coating over a braided cord which I thought would make for a sturdy cord that could hold up to the rigors of a 3 day a week runner,cord
"The cord seems pretty strong, though it took a while to get used to the sound conductivity (the cord itself conducts sound into my ears from things like bumping against my chest when I walk or run, rubbing against my shirt, etc",cord
The sound only goes through if the cord is held in a very specific and peculiar position,cord
"The cord was nice and tangle-resistant and there is a generous ratio of metal to plastic in their construction, which is rare to find in a good, affordable set of earbuds",cord
"One negative point I read about this product in other reviews is the ""sound"" it makes when the cord hits something while listening to music",cord
"Considering these are in-ear earphones that tightly sit inside one's ear isolating outside noise, anything that comes in contact with the cord is going to produce a sound that travels straight to the ear and will definitely be noticeable",cord
But don't confused this noise reduction for more expensive headphones which electronically monitor ambient sound levels and adjust accordingly,cord
"i would not recommend this to anyone, they should not cost more than two dollars, as they are poorly constructed, and when you touch the cord while they are in your ears, you hear a lot of noise",cord
"Since the ear fit for this brand is not very powerful, any slight touch on the very long cord disrupted the earphone in the ear, it just slipped out of my ear",cord
"The new pair again, sound quality is great but the mic doesn't work right, producing a heavy feedback sound that makes them petty much useless for recording anything",cord
Probably due to the cord being pulled on a few too many times,cord
"They do look nice, and the cord coils up very well",cord
I really like the design from the cord to the earpiece but it is rather fragile,cord
"PROS: fun colors, long cord, convenient case for portable protection CONS: product reliability/durability - fails in less than a year",cord
"Otherwise really good packaging, good design of the cord, they look like they are made out of high quality material",cord
"They look great, are very comfortable to wear, and the short cord is a good thing for petite folks and youngsters",cord
The biggest problem with them is if you even slightly touch the cord while the headphones are in it sounds like a thunderstorm in your ears,cord
"I received these in record time (the day before the race) and after reading the enclosure and the reviews on Amazon, I ""seasoned"" the earbuds by letting the iPod play overnight at a medium to loud setting",cord
"If I finangle the cord in just the correct way, they work, but otherwise no go",cord
"at first it would crackle in and out when I moved the cord around, and then it conked completely",cord
Fumbling with the cord where it plugs in makes the sound come on and off,cord
I bought these earphones about 6 months ago when the cord on my original iPod earbuds started to strip and you could see the wires,cord
"They fit great for walking around the neighborhood, but the simple swinging of the cord (until I fed them under my shirt) wiggled the buds loose",cord
[[EDIT: I read that wearing them around the ear prevents most of the cord movement noise,cord
Wrapping the cord around your ear rather than letting the cord just dangle gets rid of a considerable amount of the noise you don't want to hear,cord
"Unfortunately, I'm suddenly having problems with the point where the cord meets the plug, and can only use these headphones when the cord is in a particular orientation and I'm not moving",cord
"As far as the headphones go, they fit well, the cord is good and doesn't tangle easily",cord
I would have thought JLab would have reinforced where the cable cord meets the audio jack,cord
"Every time the cord touched something it reverberated into the headset, the sound quality was very tinny and there was absolutely no bass response",cord
"I'm tall, and the cord still dangles almost to my knees when I've got them on, and unless I wrap it up or shove it in my pocket, it catches on everything (door handles, chair arms, EVERYTHING) and rips them out of my ears",cord
"To my dismay, they are going the way of all cheaper headphones and earbuds - the sound changes depending on the positioning of the cord",cord
"So I've got to generally keep the cord straightened, or curved, or whatever in order to get an unaffected listening experience",cord
The adapters (even the cord) seem to be made of poor-quality materials,cord
"However, after about a month of usage, sound started to flicker out of the right earbud, although I could sometimes get it back if I fiddled with the cord enough",cord
"First of all, the length of the cord reveals the height-ist nature of the R&D folks who designed it",cord
"Also, due to material from which the cord is made, the bouncing of the cord against my chest interferes with the sound quality as the it provides it's own soundtrack over my music that can be likened to an off-beat high school marching band bass drum player or the irregular heartbeat of a large mammal",cord
There is also no carrying case so you'll have to figure out some other way of storing and managing the cord,cord
I do like that the cord is of equal length from each bud,cord
"No visible damage either (no frayed cord, etc), so it may be a defect in the manufacturing",cord
"Ordered these thinking they would be good according to the reviews, I was wrong",cord
"The cord on the headphones is alot longer than many headphones, so I also had to wrap the cord around my ipod so it wouldn't get tangled while I exercise",cord
"-----OLD REVIEW------ PROS: extremely loud - volume on the lowest setting - clear, quality sound when playing music; great fit; awesome look; cord doesn't tangle CONS: wanna-be noise canceling blows; gives me a headache! [playing, does, tangle, canceling, gives] [-----, ------, loud, lowest, clear, great, awesome, wanna-be]
",cord
That being said if you are very gentle with your headphones and don't rap the cord than these are for you,cord
More flexible cord lies more naturally and comfortably,cord
"The cord is of generous length and overall, the build of it is pretty solid",cord
"However, on a live recording or anything with a bit of static it becomes very apparent",cord
"Then after about four months, the left ear stopped working unless I turned the cord a specific way and didn't move it at all, which was a pain",cord
The extra length of the JBuds ear buds cord is a plus and the noise canceling properties are effective,cord
The length of the cord doesn't allow for anyone over five feet tall to do so without an arm band,cord

*Anti-Tangle cord is amazing and works really well,cord
"The cord is nice and long, and the silicon pieces fit well enough",cord
It is on the brink of being too short to plug into my laptop on my desk and making it to my ears without having a tight cord,cord
I may actually contact JLab support on this to see if this is a normal cord length for the J3 because it is something you see in reviews all the time,cord
"So, as far as sound quality goes, I find these better than the J2, but beware of the cord length",cord
"Still sounds good, but the cord",cord
"From my email to Jlab:  ""The J3 cord is a full 8 inches shorter than my J2s",cord
"Sound quality was fine, but if you move and the cord rub on something, anything, you hear every movement",cord
"I found I could get the sound back for a while if I bent the cord a certain way, but it would simply go out again",cord
"While they looked good and the cord never got tangled, the microphone NEVER worked at all",cord
Updated 7-8-11: No noticeable wear on the cord or ear pieces,cord
"I have found that routing the cord thru my shirt, or tucking it in the collar of my shirt helps most of the time, but does not totally eliminate the thumping noise being transmitted into the earbuds",cord
"Also, it needs more length where the cord splits to left and right sides",cord
"These fit great, but anytime the cord hit my shirt, it was so loud and it sounded like I was using a stethoscope",cord
"Not only is the sound quality different, but the earphone jack and cord are different which leads me to believe that I either received a knock-off version of this product or perhaps they changed the model slightly",cord
the only good thing is the cord is longer,cord
"I can actually hear my feet thumping as I walk, this cord noise drowns out my actual music",cord
I'm used to the tangle-free cord on my Sony MDR-E829V ($7,cord
"I have also started experiencing problems with the sound cutting out on one side, okay on the other, then okay when you jiggle the cord",cord
"After a week of this, the ear buds have become extremely touchy and only work when I hold the cord in a specific position or twist the cord or they just stop working all together",cord
Every little movement of the cord is amplified deep within my middle ear and it is extremely annoying,cord
"I can get the sound back if I wiggle the cord just right, but the sweet spot for that is getting more and more difficult to hit",cord
"I was thrilled with these - they fit great, sounded great (although didn't greatly reduce ambient sound) but after having them for only 3 days - one of the cord had 2 cracks in the black plastic through which I could see the silver wire underneath",cord
"They still work, but I had to wrap the cord in electrip tape where the rips were and it makes an unpleasant lump",cord
"Instead of being able to move while using these headphones, you must hold the cord in a certain position now",cord
"Unless my music is cranked way up, I can hear a loud bumping noise every time I so much as rub the cord",cord
"When I am listening to my IPod wearing these headphones, whenever I touch or move the cord, the sound is amplified through the earplugs and I hear the movement of the cord",cord
The pearlescent pink with metallic details is so sleek and pretty and the design of the cord is such that it never tangles the way my apple earbuds did,cord
"There is no exterior damage and I have always taken extra care to avoid unnecessary bends to the cord, but nevertheless, the wires inside have broken",cord
"This area where the cord connects to the plug is not reinforced, which is a major design flaw, and so disappointing because I loved these earbuds so much, but refuse to purchase them again only to have them break in another year",cord
"In response to other comments I have seen, the cord length works just fine for me, as I am 5'4 and the cord is plenty long enough for my height",cord
"The JBud J2s appear to have a stronger cord/plug connection, but as the J3s are supposedly an upgrade from these, and are much sleeker, I chose the J3s for $5 more, I am considering trying the J2s, but am hesitant to return to try this brand again, and may be better off with Panasonic Slimz, V-Moda Vibes, or MEElectronics M6s",cord
"The JVCs cord is completely stripped to the wires, but they are that much better",cord
"When I received the headphones, I was pleased with the sturdiness of the cord and everything seemed of high enough quality construction to last, but after a little over two months, one of the buds went out, and I ordered a pair of <a href=""http://www",cord
"I use my mp3 player almost exclusively for exercising, and even though I use a clip to secure the headphone cord to my jacket or shirt (to eliminate the tendency of the cord to pull the buds out of my ears), I often find that the buds eventually start to get loose and I need to push them back in, or they get sweaty and I need to dry them off",cord
"The Zune headphones I am replacing have a stem on the bottom of the earphone, which makes it easier to position the buds and push them in- but the JBuds just have the earphone itself and then the cord",cord
I guess I'll take my chances and maybe be a little more careful with how I wrap the cord around my Walkman,cord
"Speaking of which- the JBuds description said they have a ""micro-braided anti-tangle cable"" so I expected them to have the same sort of covering as the Zunes, but instead it looks and feels like any other headphone cord",cord
The first ones I had I would wrap the cord around my iPhone and therefor thought it was my fault,cord
They are comfy have a nice long cord and really do cut down on outside noise,cord
"According to her, the sound is excellent",cord
I loved the color and the sleek design of the cord also,cord
"They fit comfortably in the ear, the length of cord is decent, and the sound was good to me",cord
"They are basically unusable today unless I wrap the cord in a certain way and stay completely still, and even then only one side works",cord
similar sound you'd get if the cord wasn't plugged completely in the device),cord
"Next thing I know,i have to fiddle with the cord just to get both earbuds to work! [know, have, get, work] [Next]
",cord
My kitten chewed up the cord to my old creative ep-630s,cord
"I was very pleased with these headphones until, three months later, one of the headphones got scratchy and then stopped transmitting unless the cord was moved in a very precise way",cord
Now I only occasionally get sound in only one ear at a time if I have manipulated the cord in a very specific way,cord
"But this morning, when I put my ipod on, only the right side had sound (quite low I might add) and the left side would come on if I wiggled the cord",cord
The Buds themselves feel kind of chintzy and you'll have to be careful with the cord -> bud connection,cord
Could jiggle the cord and get sporatic sound,cord
If I moved the cord around it would come in and out but it never stayed on consistently - flashback to when you try to get the sound for a movie in an airplane using your own headphones and you struggle trying to get the jack to go in just the right amount to get sound in both ears,cord
"So I guess buy them if you can make sure you're careful with the cord! [guess, buy, make, 're] [sure, careful]
",cord
"I'm still happy with my J3s for casual use on the train and walking around, but a cord that eliminates this noise issue would go a long ways to improving the JBuds line",cord
"There is also minimal sound transferred to the headphones (and your ears) when the headphone cord rubs against something, another plus",cord
The fit is comfortable and the look cool with the metallic cord and housing,cord
"A longer cord would add value! [add] [longer]
",cord
"I don't know who they had in mind when they made this cord, but it must be for someone with a really long torso",cord
"When you're running, you don't want a long black cord hanging all over the place",cord
In the end I paid $5 extra for an inert bit of plastic on the headphone cord - don't bother,cord
"The cord connection gave out in two weeks, so now I have great mono-sound with comfort, or I have great stero sound by physically holding the cord at a 178 degree angle",cord
"I've bought a few pairs of them since I can't find my previous favorite any longer, and for the price I'm not terribly unhappy, but I continue to look for something that is more comfortable, has a longer cord, and lasts longer, while still looking good =)",cord
"They are small, black-on-black raised letters at the base of each bud at the cord entry point",cord
Bass output is way down from that of the actual recorded music I am listening to,cord
"Sound quality is just fine for me, but if I so much as breathe on the cord, I get a thump, the way you would if you tapped a microphone for a sound check",cord
The sound is kind of dull after a few uses and I need to move the cord in order for the sound to come out,cord
"work well and at a good price, but not very comfortable and if you are bumping it around sound travels through the cord",cord
"However, what we have here are decently constructed ear pieces with a thin nylon type cord, and this covering will not offer much protection, so you will need to be careful",cord
"When I first bought these, I thought they were fabulous -- the cord almost never tangled and the sound was quite good",cord
my only complaint so far is the amount of telescope sound that i am getting through the cord movements,cord
"To keep this in reference, I tried the headphones through a variety of different products and different quality of audio recordings",cord
"While a higher recording definitely sounded better, the same issues with boomy bass and overall muddy sound remained",cord
"Additionally, just sitting at my desk at work - where I primarily use the J3s since they are not good for the gym - often leads to issues just from moving in my chair and having the cord hit the desk, keyboard, etc",cord
"I prefer the build quality of the actual headphones on these over any others I've purchased (and that's many), but I prefer the cord of the J2s",cord
The cord on the J3s doesn't flex well and it's awkward,cord
"The cord is more plastic- y than I expected and very short as we'll, which is an issue for me",cord
The first is the length of the cord,cord
The short cord limits where you can position your music player on your body,cord
"The mouse is stellar in almost all ways - great battery life, great precision movement, great control over response and customizable buttons",battery
The look feel and battery life are fine,battery
"Some improvements over previous model: * The battery is now a standard AA type (sanyo enloop) * The receiver is very small * The mouse can be charged via USB * side scroll is now built into the wheel Overall, the muse feels allot cheaper than previous model",battery
"Logitech people, I hope you rectify and reinvent a new generation of Mice that combines improvements such: The ""Darkfield"", the location of the button to switch between windows and the small ""Unifying"" receiver of the ""Perfomance"" model, with the battery life, ergonomics and original system of rolling of the ""Revolution""",battery
"I tried a new battery, although the battery that was in it was also supposed to be new, to no avail",battery
") Otherwise, it just works fine and battery life is really long",battery
) Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable battery included - one of the best rechargeable batteries on the market,battery
"I really like the thumb groove, the silvery accents, the new Logitech receiver and that you can still see the battery level meter when you're using the mouse",battery
"I was running low on battery so I plugged it into my late 2009 iMac, and immediately got a message saying something along the lines of ""This USB device is drawing too much power",battery
"it travels well as I only use it with my laptop and it is still running on the same battery I put in it on day one, so kudos",battery
"When the battery runs down, just plug it in and keep on using it, pretty slick eh? [runs, plug, keep, using] [slick]
",battery
It is light weight even with a AAA battery,battery
"This is awesome mice, probably the 2nd most comfortable mice (1st was Microsoft) ever I used, battery is rechargeable, customizable buttons, unifying nano receiver was great",battery
"The rechargeable Li-ion battery is a neat feature, and hopefully other wireless products will start to use something similar",battery
The battery life is amazing (they should have made the rechargeable battery replaceable),battery
The battery lasts a REAL long time too,battery
"The mouse has a very nice finish, it feels very comfortable in your hand and I really liked the rechargeable battery",battery
My biggest concern was battery life which I can report is good after having used it for a while,battery
A very nice feature is it uses a AA battery so you can toss a freshly recharged battery while you recharge the one that you used up,battery
"Pros: Small Long battery life Plug-and-Play, no need to setup anything Cons The wheel button makes a VERY irritating noise when turns Stops working sometimes, then you need to push the small button underneath to reset",battery
It only uses a single AA battery compared to the Logitech's 2 AA,battery
"It tracks well, works great with both Linux and Windows, and the battery life is quite nice",battery
Takes a standard AA size NiMH rechargeable battery,battery
"Very easy set up, just plug in and use, like the battery saving features",battery
The rechargeable battery is a nice touch,battery
Just 1 AA battery and use it for a long long time,battery
"At present, still no fix when I finally drummed it into their heads that this was not ""is the battery in"" kind of problem",battery
"Ã— It's very comfortable for a small mouse Ã— Easy to hideaway and take along with your laptop Ã— USB plug connects to the back of the mouse when not in use Ã— The battery life is excellent, one AA battery every 4 weeks - and I'm on my laptop over 8 hours a day",battery
"Not everything has been perfect, the G7 gaming mouse I had required a DAILY battery swap, but an included spare was always charged and ready",battery
"The VX which ran for 6 months on a commonly used battery is an amazing achievement, it's free spinning scroll wheel had a small lever on the bottom the select between ratcheted and smooth scrolling",battery
"I'm currently on my second battery for my second mouse, and while it's great that it's very efficient in its use of energy, it's not worth it in the long run to get this mouse to only have it die on you",battery
All options allows you to use the mouse while it's being charged so you never have to worry about the mouse suddenly non-operational due to the battery,battery
One other thing I wanted to address is the battery life,battery
I was a little skepitcal on purchasing this mouse initially because of multiple reviews talking about bad battery life,battery
The battery life is a tad shorter than I would have hoped,battery
"Besides that battery life, this mouse is designed for right hand users only",battery
"It is a bit chintzy in areas like the battery cover, and the USB dongle, but it's the perfect size and price",battery
"I cannot comment of battery life, but it shouldn't be a problem with some 2200maH NiMH batteries",battery
"My main concern is that after about a month of owning the mouse the scroll wheel lost its sensitivity, now I find scrolling pages in documents to be a real chore, the click wheel has become unreliable and I have resorted to clicking the scroll bar and dragging, this is a major issue for me, I may resort to my old battery powered microsoft mouse, I havn't looked into a replacement yet, but may soon",battery
"Maybe this doesn't actually effect the battery life very much (I've only had it for a few days), but I would have appreciated a manual on/off (and, as another reviewer already said, a carrying case)",battery
"EDIT, March 2005 - I complained about the lack of an on/off switch, but this mouse has lasted for MONTHS on the initial battery",battery
"I like the fact that it's small, and the battery life is good",battery
"It's a convenient size, is nice and light, only requires 1 AA battery (included), and works very accurately and with no delay",battery
"The only way to turn off the mouse (that is, not waste battery power) is to slide the transmitter back into its docking area under the mouse (think closing the refrigerator door to make the light go out)",battery
The battery light indicator is a great feature and it's easy to recharge with the cradle,battery
"It sleeps after 30 sec or so to save the battery life, which so far has been great, I haven't seen it get down to one bar yet, even after hours of continuous use",battery
"However, the fact that the transmitter has to be disconnected from the USB port and placed in the bottom of the mouse to shut the power off and save battery power is very inconvenient",battery
One AA battery can only last about two-three weeks,battery
"I think I'll be going back to my MX1100 mouse - the MX1100 that comes in the Wave Pro combo also allows charging via micro USB and replaceable AA battery, like Performance MX",battery
"] There seems to be confusion in some minds about the battery and charging system, which I believe to be far better than the MX Revolution",battery
"It will use a standard AA battery, chargeable or non-chargeable, and has a charging system for the battery, from which the mouse can be used via USB cable while charging",battery
Just be sure not to use a non-chargeable battery with the charger connected,battery
The signal doesn't transmit vary far and only when there's a fully-charged battery in it,battery
"The battery lasts about 2 days, with 8 - 10 hours of heavy use per day",battery
"I would have liked to see the battery last as long as some of Logitech's other mice that last 12 months on 2AA batteries, but considering the darkfield laser the battery life is understandable",battery
"The battery lasts about as long as advertized, if you use alkaline duracell's anyway",battery
I tried a cheaper battery once and it died much faster,battery
"Not likely you'll need to though, as the green lights on the mouse tell you how much battery life is left, as does the software",battery
"I would seriously consider the smaller VX Revo that has virtually all the same features, but runs on a single AA battery and is much cheaper",battery
"Also one minor complaint is that the mouse itself does not light up to show how much battery power you have left, you have to check the tray on your computer to see",battery
"Battery life is very good, still on the first battery but going to need to change it as it's now down to needing to be charged every few days (used to last a week +), but charging is really convenient, I just leave the cord in the back of the computer all the time and plug it into my mouse when needed",battery
"At first, I was reluctant of purchasing a wireless mouse since I have a bad experience before where I need to replace thebattery every 2 weeks but thisone it's amazing it's been 2 months now and still haven't change the battery",battery
This saves the battery life and makes it easier to store or take around,battery
The battery life is decent; the cradle is a much better way to recharge than a cable; and the mouse tracks well,battery
"com/gp/product/B000IV2WAW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/178-0290149-7694811"">SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries</a> AA rechargeable battery pre-installed, which was a welcomed surprise as this is a really good rechargeable battery",battery
"Seriously, it's such a shame because this mouse is so gorgeous and its performance while in use is just amazing, but that battery just won't let it do what you need it to",battery
"It really is amazing, but just unmanageable with a 24 hour battery life-cycle",battery
In an effort to not make this ABOUT eneloops let me just say they are the single best rechargeable battery you can buy,battery
"Once the battery is fitted in, the mouse is significantly heavier than a normal mouse which takes some taking used to but is not a problem for every day use",battery
"I like the fact that the receiver slots into the mouse itself for storage, and this also turns the mouse off which helps conserve the battery energy, but on the other hand I would have appreciate a separate switch which would enable me to turn off the mouse without slotting in the receiver, because I often leave my laptop on sleep and it's a pain in the butt to pull out the receiver and slot it in every time",battery
#NAME?,battery
"The storage feature also is the on-off switch for the mouse, saving battery life when not in use",battery
"The reason I returned it is the weight, which really isn't Logitech's fault: the battery plus wireless transmitter has to add weight to the mouse",battery
The external charger that allows you to recharge the battery while continuing to work is a genius idea---someone should have thought of it sooner,battery
"As a frequent traveler, I appreciate that the rechargeable battery can be easily substituted with a regular battery, and that there is no charging dock",battery
This mouse is excellent in every respect except for the battery life,battery
I've replaced the included generic battery with several others in an attempt to find something that would last longer with no luck,battery
"I get that you have this ""nifty"" new laser that tracks on glass, but if it's at the expense of only getting 5-10% of the effective battery life of the previous generation mice",battery
#NAME?,battery
Microsoft states the battery can last at least six months but mine only last for a month in continuous use,battery
no new battery or fiddling seems to be bringing it back,battery
"Then after a full charge, the battery ran down to near empty in about 2 days",battery
"Lastly, the lights indicating battery charge flashed on and off every 15 seconds (which I actually thought was normal albeit a bit annoying)",battery
"First, battery life is acceptable at between 20-25 days",battery
The advertised battery life of anywhere from 6-10 months is simply a lie,battery
I went from about 100 days of use with a double A battery for the vx rev to about 4 days use with the mx,battery
"I cannot yet comment on battery life or charging issues, but after some initial use I did charge it overnight once",battery
"I have to change the battery every 2-3 weeks, which isn't terrible but a little bit of a hassle considering you don't have to worry about anything with wired mice",battery
The mouse feels great and the battery life is decent,battery
"If, however, you are a computer addict, you might want to find something more durable and with better battery life",battery
"On the plus side, after all these months, the battery still lasts a long time, like a week or so",battery
"For those first two months I fell in love with it, but for the price I expect a higher quality battery",battery
"Apparently, the technology that helps extend battery time has the opposite effect on rechargeable batteries",battery
"In terms of battery life, it seems pretty good",battery
"The only think with this mouse is the battery, Need to charge every 2 days",battery
"BATTERY LIFE: A noticeable improvement over the G7, the battery seems to last forever",battery
The MX1100 came with an Eneloop battery which lasts a long time,battery
The MX Performance came with a cheaper Chinese battery that has had to be rechaged three times in the same time period,battery
"They claim the MXP is using too much power, but I think it is just a matter of the cheap battery",battery
"It rattles everywhere: the battery cover, the left and right mouse clickers, and the scroll wheel push button",battery
"The battery life on the mouse could be longer, it doesn't last nearly as long as the VX revolution did, but I had to replace those batteries",battery
"Replaced w/energize 2450 vs 2000 mAH, and came in the next day to find the battery with one bar",battery
"Don't rely on the mouse for good battery, just charge every evening, it's a good product otherwise",battery
Using a USB cable to charge battery while using it like a corded mouse is a stroke of genius,battery
Bonus 1: It comes with a rechargeable AND easily replaceable battery,battery
"Plus the battery compartment is big enough for me to stash a spare Unifying dongle, so if I ever forget or lose the main dongle I always have a backup",battery
"The only downside, and the only reason I didn't give this mouse five stars, is battery life",battery
"It's not all that big a deal, but it would have been great to have longer battery life",battery
"well, it doesn't do cartwheels but the battery lasts and its pretty sensitive; it does everything my previous wired mouse did; reasonable in price; everything i could hope for in a mouse",battery
"I would have given the MXR 5 stars, however the rechargable battery lasts 3 days at 18 hours a day use",battery
"the battery lasts for around three months with average use, which is better than my last mouse, so i can't complain",battery
"This is a great mouse, except the battery life",battery
The rechargable battery included in the box could only sustain two or three days after a full charge,battery
Be prepared for a large investment on battery or you have to recharge the original one every two or three days,battery
"Plug in the transmitter to the proper USB port, insert the included AA battery, and the mouse is ready to use",battery
Charging the battery is a bit of a pain through the USB cord - but at least you can still use the mouse while it is charging - though it feels a bit awkward with a long cord sticking out of the front of your mouse,battery
"I love the mouse, especially because of battery durability, the tiny size of the receiver, the cute look, the smoothness of movement, the nice RF range, and the smooth scrolling wheel that I began to like",battery
The battery compartment is easy to open and the battery easily goes in and out,battery
"I replaced the battery three times with newly recharged, and then brand-new batteries, to no avail",battery
"Everything about this mouse is top-notch apart from Side scroll, which is very difficult to use on this mouse and the battery life, which is very poor",battery
"I have just about managed to squeeze out 2 days of battery life at max, with 7 hours of daily use, which is very low",battery
"But the good news is, that unlike the MX5000 mouse, the battery replacement on this one is a breeze",battery
"I don't know about the battery life, and as long as it doesn't need to be changed very frequently, it doesn't matter cause I use rechargeables",battery
"I have never ever heard of a rechargeable battery than requires recharging every three days! [have, heard, requires, recharging] [rechargeable]
",battery
My options were (a) buy a replacement battery myself (for a 3 week old mouse) or (b) send the entire thing back,battery
Not sure yet when the battery will get real low,battery
"A quick run through: * Runs on a single aa battery - a nice touch * Has 4 buttons - two are awkwardly designed * Boasts the trademarked MS BlueTrack technology - and it actually works! [Runs, Has, are, designed, Boasts, works] [quick, single, nice, trademarked]
",battery
I've changed the battery several times so that's not the problem,battery
"General pros/cons: + Construction/finish appear to be on par with Logitech's previous higher end products + Battery is user replaceable; standard rechargeable NiMH AA (Sanyo Eneloop) + Mouse can be operated in wired mode even with the battery removed + Uses the same ""hyper-fast scrolling"" scroll wheel as found on many other Logitech mice, can be switched from standard operation with detents for small movements to freewheel mode where the wheel spins freely allowing for very quick scrolling through large documents/web pages/etc",battery
"Miscellaneous thoughts: * Would be nice if Logitech included a space for the receiver in the battery compartment &agrave; la the G700, VX Nano, Marathon, etc",battery
It took a minute getting use to the variances in the MX Performance from the MX Revolution but I quickly adjusted and loved the charging system with the replaceable battery,battery
"That mouse was excellent- good battery life, a little wider and very responsive on almost any surface",battery
So far I've had to replace the battery at least 4times (using rechargeable),battery
The battery easily lasts an entire day or more,battery
"Worked great, easy to connect, battery lasted about two months",battery
I bought this mouse to replace my Logitech MX Revolution which I have had for about 5+ years now and the battery finally stopped holding a charge (I figure that many years of rechargeable battery life is pretty good),battery
New battery will last about month and a half so I suggest people getting rechargeable battery unit,battery
"There have been a couple of times where I left the mouse on in my bag overnight, and the battery was dead the next morning",battery
"and because the battery is so easily replaceable, I don't see why people are so up in arms about this issue",battery
It has the same base functionality with much better battery life,battery
The battery compartment opens in a cheap way,battery
The product page claims the battery is good for up to 10 months,battery
The only reason I didn't give this mouse a 5-star rating is the battery usage,battery
If I leave it on all the time the battery (requires one AA battery) goes dead within a week,battery
It turns off the mouse when you plug the adapter into it so it saves a considerable amount of battery life when not in use,battery
"I can only assume it's the battery since the mouse seemed to work perfectly fine when I first purchased it, but it now consistently doesn't recognize clicks or scrolling of the wheel",battery
The 3 other coworkers have noticed the same short battery life,battery
PS: Battery life was great-I never had to replace the battery once during the 4 months,battery
Be warned to keep a fresh battery in yours,battery
The battery lasts sooo long it's easy to let it go until it's too late,battery
I'm going to replace the battery and if that doesn't work I'll find a different mouse,battery
I DO NOT like the two day battery life that everyone gets before a mandatory recharge,battery
"Even with a better aftermarket battery it still dies in two days, not two months like other mice",battery
It's the ultra cheap Chinese battery Logitech ships with the MX mouse that's the problem,battery
"Having replaceable rechargeable batteries is far better than a built in battery, which the previous model had",battery
"The mouse only takes one battery, so there's no way to reduce weight like with other mice that uses two batteries but can operate on just one",battery
It comes with a rechargeable battery,battery
This would have been perfect if it had an auto-shut off feature and a rechargeable battery,battery
"The mouse runs a one AAA battery which is included, it feels comfortable in your hand and it works great on any surface",battery
One very good feature is that the receiver snaps into the underside of the mouse for storage and turn the mouse off to prolong the life of the battery (AA cell),battery
I have changed the battery several times during the past few months and again today,battery
Worked really well while with good battery life (maybe 2 or 3 batteries in that time) till the scroll wheel stopped working,battery
"A comfortable, small, very portable wireless optical mouse that turns off when you stow the tiny receiver on the mouse to conserve battery power",battery
"The battery life seems excellent though, and it can be charged while in use",battery
"The USB receiver clicks in to the bottom of the mouse for storage when your not using it, and has a simple, cool mechanism for getting to the battery, which only requires one AA",battery
"Unfortunately, there's an apparent flaw in the battery charging system that makes some mice unusable",battery
"This mouse is great: wonderful battery life, good (quiet and easy) click/scroll and lots of buttons, but it has a huge problem",battery
Battery life: I'm still evaluating this one but from what i've so far seen I got a low battery status already in just a week after fully charging it with the included AC charger,battery
You should be able to put any type of battery in there but logitech mentions that you should not exceed capacities of 2300 mAh,battery
"Weight: Its on the heavy side, as it does house 1 AA NiMH battery inside it",battery
"There's no lights on this mouse during normal usages, possibly to save battery life, but if you set one of the buttons to switch dpi (mouse sensitivity), the 3 lights blink briefly, with either the top 2 or bottom 2 lighting to indicate which mode you're in, then turns off",battery
"Also as the mouse is either turned on or off, or wakes up from sleep mode, the current battery level is displayed on the lights, from 3 green (full) to a 1 flashing red (warning)",battery
#NAME?,battery
"OK, that being said, I really preffer the battery operated models over this rechargeable type",battery
The battery operated models last a few months or more even with my long hours of daily use,battery
I'm amazed at how long the battery lasts,battery
"Microsoft claims a 10-month battery life (it uses 1x ""AA"" battery) which would be very Impressive indeed",battery
"My Nano lasts a long time but closer to 5-6 months I believe (it uses 1x ""AAA"" battery)",battery
Have had mouse for maybe 3-4d and it's already down to 1 bar on the battery meter,battery
"I replaced the battery, same thing, reset the connection, nothing, tried different usb ports, same",battery
"This mouse is ergonomic, the battery life is good, the wireless response is adequate, and it's small enough to fit in a laptop bag without being ""too small"" for extended daily use",battery
"Key features lacking in this mouse are an on/off switch and rechargable battery which apparently can only be found in the giant non-portable or micro ""hand mangler"" varieties",battery
"The battery cover and release button seem a bit weak, but I never had a problem with it though so I'd say it's negligible",battery
"It is small, battery seems to last well, but exhibits one problem that I've not had with any other wireless mouse",battery
which may be the reason Microsoft can claim long life for the battery,battery
"Forth, the battery only has about two days (max) of heavy usage",battery
Other downsides: - I DID have to replace the battery within the last six months so Microsoft's claim that is lasts 6+ is bogus,battery
"The mouse battery life can no longer last more than 2 days, no matter how much i charge it",battery
"Everytime i charge it, it will charge, then the red battery icon will flash for 10 times",battery
I realize I should be 'happy' about the rechargeable lithium-ion battery,battery
Currently my only option is to remove the battery to save energy,battery
"4) The battery life is excellent! [is] [excellent]
",battery
very compact and the USB part stores underneath and turns it off to save on battery life,battery
"My previous mouses had the ""after 5 minute use, auto off"" to save battery and I liked that",battery
I called Logitech in hopes of purchasing a new battery,battery
"Good battery life, I charge it once a week thru USB cable provided",battery
"Also, the rechargeable battery is nice but I found that it only lasts a few days with heavy use before you have to recharge",battery
"Finally, it would be nice to be able to touch some button on the mouse and see the battery level indicators light up on demand because they only display the battery level status when switching the mouse on Overall, a very nice quality desktop mouse that works on any surface",battery
"It's not a huge complaints because the included battery is rechargable and you can recharge by plugging a USB cable, but most other wireless mice has a considerably longer battery life",battery
"The sensitivity, reliability and battery life are all top notch",battery
"*easy to set up   *low battery drain   *small profile receiver, fits into mouse, so makes it good for traveling Cons: *no auto-sleep feature",battery
"(but b/c of low battery drain, its been OK even when I don't plug the receiver into the mouse)   *weak communication between mouse and receiver (there can be NO physical obstructions, I'm used to a stronger signal)   *have to reset connection between mouse and receiver every time its been on standby (at least I do, its a simple step but an annoyance)",battery
I became afraid that I would bump it too hard and mess up my USB port and also got sick of plugging it in and out all the time and attaching it to and from the actual mouse to try to save the battery,battery
"com/gp/product/B001DJ9GOS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/187-3149413-6158043"">Cordless Desktop Wave Pro</a> WAS rechargable)  A nice touch is that the MX Performance's battery is user-replacable",battery
"In some older cordless mice, the battery was sealed or soldered into place, such that when it reached the end of its useful lifespan, the mouse was meant to be discarded",battery
"However, the battery life, and overall comfort of the mouse is awesome",battery
"For a wireless mouse, battery life is important",battery
"Also, since it has only one AA battery inside instead of two find in many of other wireless mouse, it is lighter (not as light as wired ones, though)",battery
"Bad: The packaging (or manual, something) stated that the battery in the mouse can last for up to 6 months -- I've had it a few weeks and I'm on my 3rd battery",battery
"Granted, I am using rechargeable batteries now, but the battery that came with the mouse lasted all of one week",battery
"Especially if the battery is slightly low, I literally have to have the mouse right next to the USB thing in order for it to function properly",battery
As soon as they are both in use mine stops working (in theory mine has the lower battery and therefore gets blocked),battery
"Not sure if I just happened to get a bad one out of the bunch or not, but the battery life on my MX is just horrible",battery
"The mouse is great in nearly every way: it's portable, the receiver is tiny & doesn't stick out of the USB port (and it fits inside the mouse itself for transport), the battery life is outstanding, and you really can use the mouse on virtually any surface",battery
"Haven't managed to kill the mouse battery yet, so life seems pretty good",battery
"However, 6 months has passed and the battery life has diminished by 50%, of original, max",battery
"The mouse runs on a single AA battery, and should last for a while",battery
There is a battery in bottom of the package if you are brave and strong enough to get to it,battery
"Otherwise this mouse is excellent, long battery life, good feeling clicks, the hyper scroll is nice",battery
The battery consumption is huge as compared to other wireless mouses I have used,battery
The rechargeable battery lasts a long time and the mouse can still be used with a USB cable while charging,battery
"Although the Logitech V450 gives me more of a kick, because of the laser precision tracking (mouse movements feel more organic than the 3000-- and I could probably make good use of it on glossy Starbucks tables), of the battery metering, the weightiness, the cool, slick USB micro-receiver (*half* the size of the 3000's ugly one! [gives, feel, make] [more, organic, good, glossy, cool, slick, ugly]
",battery
I've dropped it several times--once so hard that the top panel and the battery popped out--but it worked fine when I put everything back in its place,battery
I changed the battery on them and they're not working; excessive lag,battery
"The mouse is also very lightweight compared to some other wireless mice, mostly due to only using a single AA battery",battery
Liked everything about the mouse except the ability of the rechargeable battery to hold a charge,battery
"It took me a while to figure out where to put the battery in the mouse, but I did not read the book, and once I figured it out, it was very easy",battery
In my experience the battery lasts at least a month,battery
"In my opinion this is pretty good, considering you can plug the receiver into the mouse to shut off the mouse (turning off the battery), which is something I have not done",battery
"I cannot speculate too much, but one double A (AA) battery will run the mouse for a month",battery
"This is a great mouse, great sensitivity, ergonomics are amazing, and decent battery life",battery
The one thing I can't live with though is the non-replaceable battery,battery
The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not have a power button and I am worried it's going to drain the battery when I am not using it,battery
I have two of these and one is going back to the factory because of a  bad battery,battery
A few have posted that the battery goes for one or two weeks or more without recharging; others have posted that the battery lasts only a day or two,battery
"worked great for a couple of years -had to replace the battery a lot because we almost never turned off the laser because of the awkward on/off switch -USB antenna gets in the way something got loose inside and it was hard to get the battery to sit right so the laser would stay on, then with no warning it just wouldn't work any more",battery
Even so I've been on the same battery for over 4 months now,battery
The battery life is simply amazing,battery
The battery life is good if you remember to insert the transmitter in the back when it is not in use,battery
Every now and then it would stop working and I would have to remove the battery cover and gently push on the battery to make a good connection,battery
this will allow for the best battery life,battery
Skip the rechargeable battery and just buy a pack of AAs and you'll be happier,battery
"This mouse is great, small, portable very responsive has decent range and runs on a single AA battery",battery
"You should now see a series of green LED's, the bottom-most a battery icon, and 3 square lights above it flashing upward as it charges",battery
"After a full day of heavy use, and leaving the mouse out of the cradle overnight, a tab in the Setpoint drivers told me I still had 5 days left on the battery",battery
"If you need to use the computer frequently, you may need to recharge the battery every few days",battery
The comfort and battery life for the mouse were both decent,battery
"But the battery life blew the G7 out of the water, which is to say it needed charging weekly instead of roughly every 4-8 hours",battery
"Of course, if you're coming from a mouse with much better battery life, you may not find that very impressive",battery
"The battery is great, lasting a real long time",battery
"As a side note, the battery life (normal duracell AA) lasted over 3 months with occasional use, which I think is pretty good",battery
It's running on either it's first or second battery & I tend to leave the laptop running 24/7,battery
It lasted about 4 months and then the battery light started flashing red,battery
That one had built-in rechargable batteries and the battery life would go many months between recharging originally to about five days currently,battery
"It has a cradle so recharging was trivial but had gotten spoiled with charging it so seldom so decided to buy a replacement  This new mouse has a single, removable battery which looks like a ni-cad and only lasts about three-four days",battery
"battery life looks good, its a month still having same AA battery",battery
"Reasons I bought this mouse: 1) Wireless 2) Rechargeable battery 3) No charging station (charges via USB) 4) Logitech I used to have a Logitech MX Laser mouse, but the left button switch went bad and started double-clicking when I wanted to single-click",battery
The clip used to secure the wireless conector to the back of the mouse (thus shutting off the battery) just doesn't hold tight enough anymore,battery
The software keeps you very well informed as to how much battery life there is left and when you are due for replacement,battery
"com/gp/product/B000TG4BA0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-7253392-3132706"">Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 Mac/Windows</a> the battery life of this mouse is absolutely exceptional",battery
"So, back to the drawing board I went, looking for the features of the performance, but with the battery management of my older mouse",battery
"It does function very much like the performance, yet the battery usage is minimal",battery
"Another thing that changed is the battery indicator, it only lights up when you haven't used the mouse in awhile so I don't how much battery is left if I'm actively using it and the battery seems to die a bit faster than my old MX, maybe because of the new laser? [changed, is, have, used, do, is, left, 'm, using, seems, die] [much, old, new]
",battery
The battery is a standard replaceable AA NiMH so even when travelling if you don't have your charger you are ok,battery
"Pro:  Excellent response and range  Ergonomic design (Atleast fits very well for my hands)  With the charging station, no more battery issues",battery
"The battery life on this is actually very good (10+ hours on most days), but the software is annoying",battery
"Firstly, I thought it must need a new battery, when I changed a new battery for it, it's condition not become any better",battery
"Also, it is battery-powered rather than rechargeable, so it won't need to be replaced as early",battery
It is small enough to carry around and has an on/off switch to avoid eating the battery,battery
)   * It has a removable rechargeable AA battery included,battery
"* I'm never exactly sure when the battery is about to die, it can go for a while on red",battery
Both mice are on the original battery after ~ 1 month of daily use,battery
I just changed the battery after 3 months for the first time today and I use my laptop daily so I'm happy with the battery life(1 AA),battery
It's nice that you can put the receiver into the mouse for storage and it also serves as an off switch but for those of us who rarely travel it's not so convenient to have to unplug the USB receiver each time you power down just to save battery life,battery
"Even using good quality alkalines, the mouse will only work if the battery is very fresh",battery
Heavy users should be prepared to remove the battery before putting it in your suitcase and to buy alkaline batteries and replace them once a month,battery
"I have been using it for the last two months almost 3 hours daily, battery seems to be still going strong",battery
The 3000 has an improved 6-month battery life (which is the only plus),battery
I also like how snapping the USB transmitter into the bottom of the mouse puts it into battery-conserving mode,battery
"If you leave the Performance MX lying around without manually turning it off or plugging it in, though, and your battery level might be ""Low"" or ""Critical"" the next day",battery
"The mouse uses one standard NiMH AA battery; I replaced it with a fresh high-quality <a href=""http://www",battery
"com/gp/product/B000IV2WAW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/188-5006204-2295021"">Eneloop</a> battery, and it lasted five days, and charged the generic included battery",battery
"When the Eneloop ran down, I put the original battery back, and it is going strong after three days",battery
"Sadly, this means opening the mouse once or twice a week to replace the battery, but I think that beats plugging the tiny plug in every day, sometimes multiple times per day, and having to use it with the stiff cord attached",battery
"Battery life is amazing, no need to use a rechargeable when the battery lasts this long",battery
"I let the receiver plug into my laptop for several hours a day, the red light of the mouse is always on, just want to see how long will the battery last",battery
#NAME?,battery
"It's a solid mouse wiht a decent heft to it so it doesn't feel cheap; I've been using it for about two months frequently and have not needed one battery change, so that is saying something",battery
"The battery is NiMH, a single Sanyo AA eneloop",battery
Unless you are on a full battery your mouse may not respond to clicks and may lag,battery
It doesn't help that it takes about a week from installing a new battery to get to this point,battery
Loved this mouse until today when after TWO separate battery changes (and I had put in a new one just a few days ago) the mouse completely stopped working,battery
"Sometimes I can get up to two months on a battery, but I just put a new battery in it today after two weeks",battery
"As long as the battery works, the mouse works great",battery
I wish it had an on/off switch to save the battery,battery
Pros: This mouse has a decent battery life and works well and does not skip around like some other cheap wireless mice,battery
"The mouse requires 1 AA battery, very easy to open the bottom cover and slip the battery inside",battery
"With the added battery, the mouse has a good solid weight to it, so that it's not too heavy to push around and not too light that it'll just slide everywhere",battery
"The battery in my other M/S mouse does last forever, so I do not doubt that this one will last",battery
this mouse is very user friendly with great different options the only draw back is that you need to recharge battery often you haft to remember to turn mouse off Amazon handling and shipping was excellent,battery
"However, battery life is good so it doesn't have to be a huge deal",battery
The nicely designed battery charger may start having connectivity problems after about an year or more of use,battery
"The mouse is rechargeable (lithium ion batteries), and it seems to hold a charge reasonably well, but after a year or so of heavy use, it may be losing charge while in standby mode-- a user-replaceable battery would have helped, but that may have sacrificed battery power by limiting its size",battery
Turning off the mouse rather than leaving it alone or in its charging stand for long periods of inactivity may help with battery longevity,battery
Saves battery life and is a great improvement from the 5000-6000,battery
The battery life was always good - about half a year,battery
I love that it uses a regular battery and I never have to plug it in to recharge,battery
"I love that you can power it down by seating the transmitter directly into the mouse - this is a huge plus, in my opinion, as it does two things: saves battery life and keeps the transmitter and mouse together",battery
This is the shortest battery life I have ever seen on a logitech mouse ever,battery
My 6-month old $94 mouse is sitting in a ziplock bag with the transmitter and battery taken out so it won't melt in the mouse,battery
Storing the USB Receiver is as inconvenient as removing the battery would be,battery
"Storage for the USB Receiver is available near the battery, under the battery cover",battery
"I was entirely disappointed, first I had to replace the battery after only 2 months and then 1 month later it died on me",battery
"I'm concerned about the battery life on this thing, as I'm sure with my usage it will only provide a mere 30%-40% battery life of which Logitech claims is possible",battery
"Although the G7 was a pain with the constant battery swap, I wish there was a similar updated model available",battery
"So how is it that 4 years later they haven't really advanced the battery technology with wireless mice? [is, have, advanced] [wireless]
",battery
Still like the small size of the transmitter and the battery life - about 9-11 month to replace the first one,battery
"mouse is a good value, a bit touchy,  but great working and the battery saver is a great Plus! [is, is] [good, touchy, great, great]
",battery
The only thing is that I hope that the battery doesn't wear out too early even if I take the USB adaptor out of my computer,battery
Reports of the amazing battery life of the Performance mouse are greatly exaggerated,battery
"However, the ONE real advantage of this new mouse is that you can recharge the battery while you're using it if you plug it in",battery
haha I am on the internet nearly 18 hours a day and the battery life lasts approximately 2 weeks using 2000mah rechargeable batteries,battery
"The battery does hold a decent charge, but only for about 10 to 12 days",battery
"I have tried remedies such as replacing battery, warming the battery with body heat, warming the mouse, flicking the on/off switch",battery
Given the humongous size of this mouse I struggle to think why this only has one battery in it,battery
The only biggest problem in the review of that one I saw was the heavy battery use,battery
Features like a on-board battery level indicator keep you informed,battery
"If you are running low on battery, you can plug in the USB power adapter and charge while using (AMAZING! [are, running, plug, using] [low]
",battery
With moderate use--nights and weekends--the recharable battery lasts me ~15 days,battery
I loved it so much that I disassembled the mouse to replace its battery with a new one when the old battery no longer accepted a charge (the old battery lasted until October 2010),battery
The Performance MX uses an easily replaceable 1900 mAh AA NiMH rechargeable battery - which comes included in the packaging - and this too is a great upgrade over the not-meant-to-be-replaced battery of the MX Revolution,battery
Inside the battery compartment there is a small compartment meant to hold the Unifying Receiver for transportation,battery
"Pros: - laser tracking works very well (although I've never had any problems with any of my Logitech mice, even the ones that used older tracking technology) - ergonomically comfortable - comes with rechargeable Eneloop battery, USB charging cable, and an extension cable so you can place the receiver closer to the mouse if needed",battery
"- ability to custom map functions to the various buttons Cons: - large and fairly heavy mouse requires a bit more effort and space to move around - only runs off a single AA battery - battery life is not very good (about 2-3 weeks) - SetPoint software only displays battery life as full/good/poor instead of the more accurate ""XX days remaining"" - button placement is awkward",battery
For some reason this mouse completely sucks my batteries dry within about 3 weeks using either type of battery (I never turn my mouse off and I use it about 2-4 hours daily),battery
They all had significantly longer battery life  than this mouse,battery
"Not sure why that is, but I'm going to stick with rechargeables now so I don't have to keep putting in a new battery every month",battery
Pro: Good Ergonomics Con: Requires frequent battery re-charge,battery
"For some reason with the Rechargable Battery that comes with the mouse it will only last no more than 2 weeks, I had to buy a Sanyo rechargable battery for this one and still it wont last more than 3 weeks (This is with at least 8 hours a day usage and Day and Night ON, the MOUSE), But by my surprise when I put in a normal Alkaline Battery it lasted a little more than 2 Month, so whats with this? [comes, last, had, buy, wont, is, put, lasted] [more, rechargable, last, more, least, normal, more]
",battery
"I am all about saving the planet, but to charge the battery every two weeks is not practical for me",battery
I have the bluetooth dongle about 2ft from the mouse at all times and have replaced the battery twice,battery
"At least the battery is a standard rechargeable AA (that will probably change with the next ""Performance mouse""",battery
To make sure it wasn't a power issue I removed the Sanyo Eneloop AA battery and replaced it with a fully charged Duracell,battery
"The replacement mouse works better, although there's no way to tell how much charge the battery has until it's dead",battery
Improvements are a lighter touch on the left/right click and perhaps the replaceable battery if that was an issue before,battery
Only needs one small AAA battery,battery
The reviews that say it is poor are a little baffling to me as I have never seen a problem with the battery time,battery
"Good battery life, but only lasted 1 year",battery
"It fits nice in my hand, has a nice weight, and the battery lasts forever",battery
I had an MX Revolution and the non-replaceable battery was starting to require more charging,battery
It's design makes it as compact as possible; though there is some small gaps internally that could possibly be better utilized for a second battery,battery
"I charge mine each Friday before I leave the office and unplug it when I get in on Monday, the battery lasts at least the week but I haven't pushed it because I don't have to",battery
"I have yet to replace the battery after using the mouse a few hours a day for over 3 months! [have, replace, using] [few]
",battery
im writing this now coz the battery finely went flat after 17 days,battery
I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help,battery
However the battery that came with it doesn't last very long a week at the most,battery
"I bought this mouse 4-5 months ago and it worked pretty well until now - suddenly I started getting intermittent problems as skipping and non-responsiveness, even with brand new battery",battery
"Also, battery life is more or less 1 month with heavy use",battery
I've been using this mouse on my laptop both in its mobile and docking station setups for 7 months and have only replace the battery once,battery
The weight of the battery is not noticeable to me but the use of a better Teflon type material for the coaster feet is warranted,battery
The mouse functions on one AA rechargeable battery & seems to have good stamina,battery
The plus side is the small receiver and battery charging capability,battery
"you will find yourself replacing the battery if you are a gamer, other then that great mouse, even works great with mac",battery
"The mouse comes with rechargeable battery and accessories to charge the mouse via USB or wall AC jack (via proprietary cables, do not lose them! [comes, charge, do, lose] [rechargeable, proprietary]
",battery
This replaced our battery-hungry previous mouse,battery
Although we encounter range issues from over 6-7 feet (our pc is our 'tv') the battery life and value more than make up for it,battery
The battery life tends to run fairly conservative,battery
I did opt for a rechargeable Nicad AA battery and it is doing fine,battery
"Hence, the battery is very good",battery
"The bad, at least for me, include plastic wearing/peeling and the lack of a removable battery",battery
"It's a rechargeable battery, what did you expect? ['s, did, expect] [rechargeable]
",battery
"The only problem with this mouse is the battery power, however it is one of the longer lasting battery life batteries, it is still very short",battery
"Now this is really cool that you don't need to change batteries however note that MX does not ave a good battery life (actually it has a poor one! [is, do, need, change, note, does, ave, has] [cool, good, poor]
",battery
"also so does the battery as I came across by looking at lots of reviews over the internet 3 - Might be 2 big if you want to consider it as a laptop mouse VX Revolution, Pros: 1 - Excellent battery life",battery
This is a great mouse the only thing lacking is an on off switch I use it on both my desktop and laptop but I like to leave the usb connected when I use the desktop so I wedge a pice of plastic in the mouse to turn it off and save the battery,battery
"----- The product literature claims a 10 month battery life - if true, this is one area where it would beat the pants off of the 5000",battery
"Great features, i did my homework, this is the best there is out there, but beware of the battery life",battery
"It's small, light way, and requires only one AAA battery, which lasts forever",battery
"While this mouse performs well and uses only one AA battery, the ergonomics and quality are poor",battery
"However, I have had it less than a month and I already had to change the battery",battery
The battery drains very fast compared to my previous older version of the MX,battery
Another thing the battery life seems to quickly be getting shorter but I still only have to charge it shortly every other day so no issue,battery
Another crucial selling point is an advertised 10-month battery lifespan using a single AA battery,battery
"Overall: I just plugged in the nano transceiver into the USB port, plopped in a new battery, and was using the mouse in Vista within a minute",battery
This helps preserve the precious battery,battery
"Pros: To be fair, it gets the basic features you want for a mobile mouse: small form factor, long lasting battery, snap-in receiver, auto shut-off",battery
The last and minor complaint is about the build quality: the upper-rear piece (battery chamber cover) got a sharp edge and kept scratching my palm,battery
"Well, I have no complaints about the device until now, It has met all my expectations about a Notebook USB mouse, It's light and compact(the reciever fits into the mouse when you are on the GO), the usage is pretty smooth and precise, the battery life is good(about 6 months on a AA battery,that's what I heard from my friends) so it's pretty decent",battery
The battery is a single internal/removable AA NiMH,battery
"To get it working again, I have to remove the battery, unplug the usb, reinsert everything and then hope for the best",battery
The only way to power it down intentionally is to take out the battery,battery
"I started using it and one thing I did not like was the short range of communication among the USB plug and the mouse, I used a new alkaline AA battery but I thought that the real reason is that the mouse RF is weak",battery
"If the battery life is all it's cracked up to be (10 months) I'll be impressed, but I've only had the mouse a few days",battery
"On the downside, it has one or two fewer buttons than the older MX1000, and instead of a replaceable battery system like the G7, you have to plug it in to recharge from time to time",battery
But battery life of 4 days under very heavy use makes up for that,battery
I recommend using a lithium AA battery instead of alkaline as they last a lot longer,battery
It also claims a 10-month battery life,battery
"That's pretty impressive for mouse battery life, though I have a feeling they estimate that based on minimal usage and mine will not last nearly as long",battery
"The most impressive part about it all, is the battery life",battery
"Luckily though, the battery life is awesome",battery
I have not used it long enough to test overall battery life through repeated charging but the unit has power saving capabilities,battery
The battery should last a long time between charges but I am curious about the design of the charger,battery
Overall it's been a good mouse when the battery isn't dead,battery
"However, stealing the nearest AA remote battery (because I never seem to have new batteries) will fix the problem",battery
In addition over the last week the battery has randomly failed on me even though it is fully charged,battery
I had used only one battery in the first six months,battery
"Then a year and a half ago I went on the road in my RV, but not before I bought a good battery charger (from Amazon) and a 12-pack of rechargeable batteries to keep my digital camera, my flashlight, and the mouse fed",battery
"Same battery now for well over 2 months, and I use it a lot",battery
One nice advantage to this mouse is that you can stow the transceiver in the bottom quickly without removing the battery cover,battery
and the battery life is great and it charges pretty quickly,battery
I have the smaller Logitech Anywhere MX mouse and it's awesome with great battery life,battery
"The funny thing is, when I bought it I swore the packaging advertised the battery life at 6 months",battery
The battery life (so far) has been great,battery
"It charges very quickly, and it lasts a very long time, but every battery runs out of juice eventually, and when it does, I spend a couple days charging it in 10-minute increments",battery
My battery results seem more favorable then some - I can get around a week of constant use between recharges without any problems,battery
Only had it about 2 months and the same battery is going strong which is nice,battery
"Directions didn't clearly show where to put the battery in and I broke one of the top parts looking for the way to find it but it still worked, for awhile anyway",battery
"All in all great mouse: - Good ergonomic shape - Low rolling resistance - Very small USB dongle - Corded back up to charge battery while working (* why don't they do this with more mice? [rolling, Corded, charge, working, do, do] [great, Good, ergonomic, small, more]
",battery
"For the price they are charging, they could use a better quality battery",battery
The Revolution battery would last me over a week on one charge of regular usage,battery
The battery life of this mouse should be a lot better,battery
"It's also nice that if my battery dies, I can plug it in and use it instead of having to put it in some kind of charging tray like one of my other older mice",battery
"The included software will give you a pop-up notice before your battery dies, good thing",battery
"The mouse is great: battery duration, power charging, precision are all really good",battery
"So, long story short this mouse is useless with having to replace the battery twice a month! [is, having, replace] [long, useless]
",battery
"I inserted the included AA battery, turned the mouse on, then plugged the transceiver into a free USB port on my laptop",battery
There is also low battery indicator just below the scroll wheel than blinks red when your battery is low,battery
Several battery changes didn't help,battery
"Now, the mouse sometimes works, other times just stops randomly even though all the lights are on, new battery, and pressing the connect button",battery
"Everything (tracking, battery, receiver, etc) was working great",battery
"Am going to try the Logitech Wireless Marathon Mouse M705, as there will be no recharging battery hassle, and the price will be a bit more reasonable",battery
"That makes this mouse a questionable choice for use with a laptop, unless you intend to carry the charging base with you when you travel for any length of time (there is no separate battery backup option)",battery
I purchased this about 6 months ago based on the claim of extended battery life and I end up having to replace the AA every week,battery
My previous mouse was a Logitec Performance mouse and the battery lasted months and was an all-around better mouse and even though the logitec was initially more expensive I realize now I'll spend way more in batteries for this microsoft mouse than my old Logitec,battery
Have only had this a couple of days so don't have much to say about the battery life or life expectancy in general,battery
It comes with a replaceable AA NIMH rechargeable battery and the life of it is great,battery
"(it doesn't) Will the battery drain really quick? [does] [quick]
",battery
What made me choose this mouse was the fact that it ships with a *replaceable* Eneloop battery,battery
"Not only are Eneloops the best rechargeable batteries (in fact, I power tons of devices with them) but if at any time in the future the charge in the battery just isn't holding like it used to, replace it! [are, is, holding, used, replace] [best, rechargeable]
",battery
"But not only that, Logitech provides a great, thin mini-USB cable which you can attach to the mouse to charge the battery back up AND you can still use the mouse while it is charging",battery
"The two unfortunate features of this mouse are its power-hungry battery consumption and the need to ""wake"" the mouse before it is ready for use",battery
"It was great, and except for a battery every once in a while, I never had any problems with it at all",battery
"Does the job, but if you are not going to use the MOUSE for a while, make sure to disconnect the battery",battery
It wasn't battery problems either; I would have the same problem with a fresh set of batteries,battery
"While it functioned excellent at the beginning, over the last couple of months I've noticed that it started to react slowly as I used it, like the battery power was low (even with a fresh battery)",battery
I thought that the internal rechargeable battery on this mouse would be a drawback but this mouse has a crazy battery life; this is good because once it starts dying even if it only holds 1/18th of the original capacity it will still be usable for a day,battery
"Speaking of which, the integrated battery leds in the trim of the mouse are an elegant touch",battery
The battery time i wish was higher but its not bad either,battery
"The Microsoft's one is larger, has more moving parts and lower battery life time",battery
"The only thing I found is that it does not have an on/off switch, so you will have to take the battery off if you want to extend battery life a little longer",battery
Charging while using the PMX defeats the purpose of wireless mouse and battery life is also less,battery
#NAME?,battery
I have make sure the battery is fully charged,battery
"When I first starting using this mouse it seemed to work fine, it was small and claimed to have good battery life pfff ya right the description said 8 to 10 months but I was replacing my batteries after a few weeks, also it sticks alot even when the battery isn't low",battery
It is still precise even the battery is low,battery
"Unlike many people, I find the battery life sufficient",battery
The LEDS on the side of the mouse also give you a good indication of battery level,battery
It has a pic of a battery then 3 squares above that which all light up green when fully charged,battery
As the battery drains each button will disappear and finally the LED will turn red letting you know its almost out of juice,battery
uses single AA battery that seems to last for a good period of time,battery
"They could improve the grip in where is written the logitech logo and the battery lifetime, but, the mouse has more qualities that compensate that",battery
the battery lasts a long time,battery
"I have to put a new battery (I use the ones for digital cameras, not the cheap ones) every 3-4 days, but overall, it's a good mouse",battery
It runs off a very good rechargeable battery,battery
"If you're smart, you'll buy an extra Eneloop AA battery and keep it charged, assuming as I have that most people have a battery charger around the house",battery
The battery is a user replaceable standard rechargeable AA battery,battery
"This is great, have a charger next to the desk and keep a spare charged at all times, when battery dies, take battery out, put it in charger, and put charged battery in mouse",battery
I was always assuming it was the battery since the lifespan is short of amazing,battery
The battery that recharges inside the mouse didn't even last 6 months before it stopped working completely,battery
"
",battery
"I've had this mouse for about an hour now and I've come to these conclusions: - The scroll wheel is nice and smooth but will take some getting used to - Movement is generally precise but has been occasionally jerky and unresponsive - Mouse feels good in the hand though is a bit heavy (I realized I pick up the mouse to go across two monitors sometimes) - The buttons near the thumb (left and right arrows) seem pretty useless and really, really irritating to my thumb, if they weren't there this mouse would feel 100% better Maybe I still have to get used to it but I just might be shipping this thing back",wheel
My second complaint is the middle mouse button (or the mouse wheel button),wheel
"Also, I REALLY miss the auto-free-spin switch feature (where if you scrolled very quickly, the wheel would automatically toggle to free spin mode, and toggle back when you stop)",wheel
"And finally, I've gotten so used to having the mouse wheel button function as the free-spin toggle that I often find myself clicking that when I'm trying to switch to free spin mode",wheel
"That said, the zoom button on the Performance MX, which you toggle by pressing the button and change by using the middle mouse wheel, will suffice and should please anyone who frequently needs to zoom but never had dedicated buttons for it before",wheel
The main feature of the revolution MX was implementation of the wheel button,wheel
"The wheel action was very smooth, with a heavy metal wheel",wheel
"When you spin the revolution wheel fast, it turns into free spin action, allowing fast page scrolling",wheel
"In order to get free spin, you have to press a button under the wheel, which is much less convenient",wheel
"Some improvements over previous model: * The battery is now a standard AA type (sanyo enloop) * The receiver is very small * The mouse can be charged via USB * side scroll is now built into the wheel Overall, the muse feels allot cheaper than previous model",wheel
My biggest complaint is the ridged texture of the scroll wheel,wheel
"The scroll-wheel is great, the buttons are great, but this mouse fails at its fundamental task",wheel
Not only eliminated the excellent system of the wheel but also worsened the overall design making it bigger and less ergonomic,wheel
"Lastly, the flywheel is amazing on long page scrolls",wheel
) The left/right scroll wheel action no longer clicks as it did on previous MX mice,wheel
There's no obvious feedback that you've pushed the wheel in either direction,wheel
My one real complaint is that the touch wheel is a bit over sensitive,wheel
Sometimes when I am scrolling with the wheel the mouse decides that I clicked it and goes into scroll lock which can be a bit frustrating,wheel
"The SetPoint software also touts the ability to allow you to assign application-specific key-presses or functions to the various mouse buttons, but I found that it couldn't do something as simple as register a press on the mouse-wheel as a middle-click (despite the software allowing me to set it up this way)",wheel
"2nd, the Rocketfish's scrollwheel also has the ability to lean left and lean right, which allows you to scroll left or right using the wheel (and not just up and down like 'regular' mice)",wheel
"There's a ""turbo wheel"" of sorts that allows super fast scrolling through webpages, but I have yet to figure out how to make it work",wheel
Beneath the scrollwheel there is a small button that I think most people have mistaken for being a scroll speed enhancement,wheel
Apple Safari does not work if you want use the scroll wheel but it's still mostly functional,wheel
Only real complaint is that the thumb wheel is located a little far back for people with larger hands,wheel
"I love the free-spinning wheel for moving around in long documents, and I also like the back and forth scroll action available from the wheel --- if you press it to the side, you can scroll from left to right",wheel
"This mouse is very comfortable, it glides smoothly and the flywheel mousewheel is amazing",wheel
"Pros: Small Long battery life Plug-and-Play, no need to setup anything Cons The wheel button makes a VERY irritating noise when turns Stops working sometimes, then you need to push the small button underneath to reset",wheel
The scroll wheel was just the last straw,wheel
"I couldn't find any great Logitech or Microsoft mouse that was: ergonomic, had a scroll wheel, and had extra programmable buttons",wheel
The wheel itself has a surprisingly large moment of inertia and allows you to quickly scroll down web pages just by flicking the wheel,wheel
"The nano mouse has a button on the top right down the wheel which I used to search things, it works very nice",wheel
"Since the wheel is exactly for that, scrolling its impossible to press it down without scrolling at least a little the page and that is all it requires to cancel the function of the button",wheel
But after a few months of use first the rubber came off the scroll wheel,wheel
The scroll wheel in the middle of the mouse now spins free or clicks depending on the application and how fast the user turns it,wheel
The Internet page Back and Forward buttons do not work as well for me as they did on the MX1000 and the search button is in a frustrating position directly under the scroll wheel which means that if you finger slips it hits the search button and up pops whatever engine you have designated,wheel
"The main wheel free spins, and can zoom through things rather quickly",wheel
The side 'wheel' can be used for many things,wheel
It adds quite a bit of friction to what I can only guess is the 'bottom' of the whole wheel mechanism,wheel
This mouse's greatest feature is also it's most disappointing flaw: the hyper-fast scrolling wheel,wheel
"The concept of a frictionless scrolling wheel is great and it makes a lot of sense, considering that many of us spend hours clicking through long web pages or documents",wheel
"In clicky mode, the scroll wheel clicks like your old fashioned scroll wheel, except it moves much more easily than your standard mouse",wheel
"In spin mode, the wheel moves without any friction, so it can be spun with a flick of your finger and allowed to come to rest on its own",wheel
"By default, the middle-click (achieved by pressing on the scroll wheel) on the MX Revolution changes shift modes from click-to-click to spin",wheel
"Fortunately, you can use the Logitech Control Center (on Mac, which is SetPoint on Windows) to change the scroll wheel's click behavior to middle-click rather than to change modes",wheel
"In a long document, I could give the scroll wheel a spin, and the mouse would whizz into free spin mode and, as the spin slowed down to a stop, the mouse would eventually *CLUNK* back into click-to-click mode",wheel
The problem with this setup is that -- even though the middle-click is now a proper middle-click -- the mouse wheel is so sensitive that actually pressing on the scroll wheel causes the page to scroll,wheel
"So, if you're viewing a multi-page document in Firefox and you'd like to open a link in a new tab by middle-clicking, by the time you've applied pressure to the scroll wheel, the page has zipped out from underneath the cursor and you are clicking elsewhere",wheel
"Unfortunately, because the MX Revolution is so unique, these third party drivers cannot control the mouse's scroll-wheel features, rendering them largely useless",wheel
The scroll wheel however may be a bit too smooth for some people,wheel
#NAME?,wheel
"Because, what happens is when you scroll the wheel, you don't really get any tactile feedback to indicate whether you have scrolled one tick or two or three",wheel
The scroll wheel is designed to serve as the middle button,wheel
It only works when the wheel is pressed down in a specific way/direction,wheel
"It had 10 programable button functionality (tilt left/right), three buttons including center wheel push, four thumb buttons, and a button to switch between free spin wheel and detent wheel (awesome)",wheel
The MX/VX series of mice with their free spinning scroll wheel were still to this day the best mice ever created by mankind,wheel
"The VX which ran for 6 months on a commonly used battery is an amazing achievement, it's free spinning scroll wheel had a small lever on the bottom the select between ratcheted and smooth scrolling",wheel
"Since I have never operated any of my free wheeling Logitech mice in any mode other than free wheeling, I am hoping to disassemble this one and remove the annoying button",wheel
I've never used a hyper-scroll wheel before,wheel
I believe the older Microsoft mice just had a smooth wheel,wheel
Positioning the mouse for optimum use of the top buttons and scroll wheel moves your thumb away from the application switching wheel,wheel
"I had to adjust my mouse settings in Control Panel, but I think that's because laser mice are more sensitive than wheel mice",wheel
"Minus a star for its size (which I should have researched more) and a minor annoyance with the scroll wheel (a little sensitive to clicks), really good mouse",wheel
"The side buttons are not nearly as useful as the thumb wheel on the Revolution, the button placement is awkward, too much of a reach",wheel
"I just received this mouse and it seems to be pretty decent, but there is a problem with the scroll wheel",wheel
I reprogrammed one of the buttons to perform a keystroke to open a new tab in IE (which is the only thing I used the wheel-click for previously),wheel
"It opens the new tab, but it's just a generic tab, not to a specific site/link and it pops up right away--you can't open the tab behind the one you're in and stay in the one you're in at the same time like you could with a typical wheel-click",wheel
", have the middle/wheel button show/hide all tools in Photoshop",wheel
"Before I bought Performance MX, since its zoom button has to be combined with scroll wheel in order to zoom up/down, I thought the zoom button could also be programmed to work with scroll wheel to control volume as well",wheel
"And finally, the scroll wheel doesn't tilt much or click, so it's very hard to scroll left/right on a page",wheel
I use a Logitech for my desktop and it has a very smooth operating wheel in comparison to this microsoft mouse in which the scroll feature clicks with each turn or operation of the scroll wheel,wheel
"Although I may consider giving it another try if I excahnge it, I may compare other brands and or models due to the bad scroll wheel design",wheel
If you use the scroll wheel a lot and your mouse has a pretty smooth feel to it then you will know what I mean the first time you try this model,wheel
"In addition to the usual left/right clickers and the scroll wheel, there are also two additional button controls on the sides, and these can be used for additional tasks like moving forward and backward through web page",wheel
"It has it's bugs (in Vista x64 it would sometimes forget your settings on startup and you would need to double click the SetPoint taskbar icon for it to activate - an example is the wheel setting, being click-to-click or middle button)",wheel
"Which, in turn, comes with many features of which: - Configurable wheel (free to spin - or normal click-click-click), if you don't want a middle-button you can set it to shift between the two",wheel
#NAME?,wheel
"- 2 additional buttons on the side, and one in the middle just behind the wheel - configurable to whatever you like",wheel
"Though this model does work fantastic on glass, the precision of the mouse cursor is great my main issues is the button configuration and the scroll wheel",wheel
"This makes a lot of accidental scrolling and disjointed scrolling, if I happen to scroll down quick with the precision button on (makes the wheel click for more precise scrolling) the scroll will eventually scroll up in a middle of scrolling down, or vice versa",wheel
"For the money this mouse cost I would have thought it would have been the perfect mouse, I was wrong and the fact I use the scroll wheel a lot when doing graphic design and illustrations on Photoshop makes this mouse as useful as a 20 year old ball tracking mouse",wheel
"3> It would make sense to configure the button just behind the wheel to act as middle click button, no? [make, configure, act] [middle]
",wheel
"Left and right tilt of the scroll wheel are treated as only one setting in LCC, and the list of functions tilt can be set to perform is VERY limited",wheel
Ditto for the forward and backward rocking of the Thumb wheel,wheel
"While the fly-wheel-like ""Free Spinning"" mode can come in very handy, the software tended to constantly switch to that mode at various times it was NOT assigned to; almost every time i switched apps",wheel
"I wound up setting most apps for manual shift, which is accomplished with the center (scroll wheel) button",wheel
"It DOES make available left-tilt, right-tilt, forward-thumb-wheel, and backward-thumb-wheel, as 4 separate buttons which can be assigned to anything in that software's long list of functions",wheel
"The reasons for my giving this mouse 2 stars instead of 1 are it's incredible comfort in my hand, the nice feel of the scroll wheel, the number and good placement of buttons (almost as good as the MX-1000), and usefulness of the scroll wheel's ""Free-Spinning"" mode",wheel
"I probably would have kept it and used USB Overdrive, doing without the one button, IF the scroll wheel mode-shifting hadn't broken down after such a short time",wheel
"ATTENTION LOGITECH: A mouse with this ergonomic design, this scroll wheel with a rugged purely mechanical mode switch button, the thumb wheel, AND the button arrangement of the MX-1000 would be the ultimate mouse! [be] [ergonomic, rugged, mechanical, ultimate]

Buttons and click wheel feel great to me,wheel
It lacked that cool IBM blue illuminated scrolling wheel but had the advantage of being wireless,wheel
"well, the scroll wheel on top works- I found the wheel to feel nice and its movement very fluid",wheel
I have used this mouse with windows XP and VISTA works great the thumb wheel is a pretty cool instant ALT + TAB for vista users,wheel
I was all set to get a new Performance MX and then I find out SmartShift is gone on the scroll wheel and that killed it,wheel
Set that wheel to use the smooth as silk detents when you're scrolling slowly and carefully and automatically freewheel when you want to scroll a long doc/web page/spreadsheet/code quickly and it's heaven,wheel
"Newer Logitech mice that have a two-mode wheel, like my recently purchased G500, use a physical button instead",wheel
"The document flip wheel is useful both in Windows for quickly flipping through a large number of open windows, and in games",wheel
"I had a little trouble scrolling with the wheel when playing games, I really had to flick that wheel to get it to respond",wheel
"In addition, you can enable the tilt wheel on the Logitech for horizontal scrolling (good with Excel)",wheel
The scroll wheel is the best I have ever experienced,wheel
I prefer click-by-click scroll wheel and that mode feels like every other Logitech mouse,wheel
The smooth free wheel mode takes some getting used to,wheel
"And there is a slight, but noticable ""clunk"" when the wheel changes mode",wheel
"Clicking the wheel button down takes more effort than it should -- which is why this is not a great mouse for users of Maya and other 3D programs (you use the middle button A LOT in Maya! [Clicking, takes, is, is, use] [great, other, 3D, middle]
",wheel
"While the mouse itself had great pointer response and moved very nicely on my desk, the scroll wheel is what ended the relationship for me",wheel
"Even the ""clicker"" button, makes the scroll wheel ""feel"" like previous mice did, was bad",wheel
"One would expect each wheel scroll to translate into 1 movement, but instead it was varied and never the same",wheel
"Now, it worked perfectly if you angled your finger's force to be perpendicular with the scroll wheel buttton! [worked, angled, be] [perpendicular]
",wheel
"This is a problem, however, because the scroll wheel itself is slanted to the right relative to the surface you have the mouse on",wheel
"So, if you push straight down on the button, the mouse thinks you are either doing nothing, or trying to push the scroll wheel to the right to scroll right instead of middle click",wheel
There's a little button behind the scroll wheel that is intended to enable you change the scroll speed from slow to fast,wheel
My old one didn't have horizontal wheel scroll or back/forward buttons so hence I went mouse shopping,wheel
"I saw this mouse at BestBuy and after looking through the other mice, I settled on this one for reasons such as: 1) clicks are quieter than the Logitechs' 2) Scroll wheel is smooth, quiet, and has a nice grip (only Logitech ones w/ nice quiet scroll wheel are the ones with the hyperscroll feature) 3) Curious about BlueTrack technology 4) Was rather inexpensive compared to other leading competitors So I set it up at home on my MBP and I really enjoyed using it at first",wheel
"I was able to program the buttons to do what I wanted them to do, but I was disappointed I couldn't program the mouse wheel's ""horizontal scroll"" to act as buttons since the newer Logitech software can do that",wheel
About the only drawback I can see in funtionality is with the wheel on the mouse,wheel
"I really, REALLY like the free-spinning wheel, and the ergonomics are excellent, but the radio problems render it unusable",wheel
The scroll wheel also has a good feel to it and moves smoothly and precisely,wheel
"Eventually the adhesive for the grip wore off, leaving a round rubber piece that wasn't ""attached"" to the scroll wheel",wheel
"Another thing to note is that after about 8 months the scroll wheel click (also known as the ""middle click"") became unresponsive",wheel
I can move the wheel a little and there is a delay before pages scroll,wheel
"Also, the scroll wheel button is a bit stiff",wheel
"On the plus side, the unique ""clutch"" wheel lets me spin it to get to the middle of a long list and move by smaller degrees when needed",wheel
The scroll wheel feels pretty nice and has a smooth and a tactile setting that stays locked (unlike prior Logitech mouse versions where it would click out of the setting randomly),wheel
Only flaw we could find is that the middle scrolling wheel scrolls down the page way too quickly,wheel
"For comparison, the MXR introduced a smart-shift scroll wheel",wheel
"Basically the function of it was an interior mechanism that, with software detection, would notice HOW you were scrolling the wheel and automatically shift from interval scrolling to an ""infinite"" scroll, allowing you to get through documents in a breeze",wheel
"With Setpoint, this function could be tweaked (how fast must you scroll before the wheel goes infinite), or turned off entirely",wheel
#NAME?,wheel
This is very annoying - all mice I have (even including ones costing only $10) have better scroll wheel feel,wheel
On a Mac (Snow Leopard) the left and right buttons and the scroll wheel work right out of the box,wheel
They removed SmartShift from the scroll wheel and took the top button and replaced it with some mechanical shift mechanism,wheel
""" They way they talk about the amazing scroll wheel on all MX products, I just assumed SmartShift was a feature in all MX mice",wheel
"It glides smoothly on the desk, the scroll wheel rotates smoothly, even the buttons feel smooth when you click them",wheel
"On the other hand, the ""thumb wheel"" is not a wheel at all",wheel
"This thing with the wheel on the MS Performance, though, it's something I run into everyday; it's not like a small change in shape that you can get used to after a while unless you learn to stop trying the use the side-click on the wheel altogether -- I can't break the habit because I use it often on diff machines with MX Revs or MX 100 mice",wheel
The problem is that the roller wheel broke and did not respond and wasn't making those clicking sounds anymore on the 4th day after I purchased it,wheel
"The scroll wheel is good, but I sometimes lose control of it on spreadsheets",wheel
Automatic shifting between normal and freewheeling scroll wheel modes was very useful,wheel
"I loved to flick the wheel, let it spin, then move the wheel slightly backwards to get that THUNK feeling of the gear dropping back into position for normal mode",wheel
"Pros: Accurate, works on most surfaces, comfortable, tiny receiver Cons: Horrible backward/forward button design, can't redefine mouse wheel left and right click The design of this mouse has highs and lows",wheel
"Logitech mouse software will let you redfine the left and right leaning click of the mouse wheel so they act as forward and backward, but Microsoft won't",wheel
"The ONLY button that can be set as Middle is the scroll wheel, which doesn't click as well as other wheel",wheel
"The search button can't be assigned to all the functions available to back, forward, and wheel tilt",wheel
"Worse for my usage needs (gaming and graphic design programs), when clicking the middle button it's very easy to accidentally trigger the mouse wheel",wheel
"It's slick that the wheel comes with two levels of resistance, one for fast smooth scrolling, and another for the more traditional graduated scrolling with resistive clicks",wheel
It sounds like some people have no problem with the middle wheel/button,wheel
If the middle button & wheel weren't so important for my uses I'd be very happy,wheel
"""The problem is on the mini-PCB which is used to detect the left, right, and middle mouse buttons, as well as handle the scroll wheel",wheel
This one replaces it with a button that switches your scroll wheel to hyper scroll,wheel
There is a 'flip document' button/wheel on the side of the mouse,wheel
"On all of logitechs high end mice, they have the adjustable scroll wheel",wheel
"The indexed gear is just like a normal wheel, you move it, it clicks",wheel
"My one complaint against it would be the mouse wheel, which takes a bit more pressure than one would like to click down to perform third-mouse button functionality",wheel
"The scroll wheel, the assortment of programmable buttons, the precision, and the overall feel are satisfactory",wheel
"If you wish to use the directional 'scroller' (in which you can move a page up, down, left and right), you need to click the wheel",wheel
The problem: You need to use very little pressure to click the wheel instead of simply scrolling a couple of lines,wheel
"Some, if not all other mice allow you to either have smooth scrolling, or click-scrolling, so you can feel feedback as you scroll the wheel, which I prefer",wheel
USB Overdrive will even allow you to map the tilt-scroll wheel as buttons so you will have more 'buttons' on the top,wheel
With the old Revolution the wheel settings seem stable and Setpoint has a wheel tab,wheel
"It has both a forward & back button, a smooth scroll wheel and texturized sides for grip",wheel
"Scroll wheel and buttons work fine, side-scrolling with wheel is a little awkward because you expect some sort of resistance feedback or click and there is none",wheel
"By default it uses a 1000 dpi setting I believe but you have to assign the DPI setting to a button (I use the wheel press) to set a secondary option (for me I have done OK with 700 dpi, not quite as sensitive to every slight movement)",wheel
"2ND UPDATE: * The Mousewheel has now begun to malfunction, which was my initial fear",wheel
The only reason I'm going to purchase another of these is that I just love the free-scroll wheel,wheel
I also agree with other reviews about the smooth-scroll wheel,wheel
"I immediately noticed some strange performance from the main scrollwheel, which allows you scroll vertically through documents",wheel
I click my scroll wheel all the time in order to open a new tab in Firefox,wheel
This material is also present on the oversized center mouse wheel and side wheel,wheel
"Scroll Wheel: The center scroll wheel allows for normal paging through documents, but if you flip it with a tad more vigor, the ""clicking"" device disengages and the wheel runs freely, allowing you to scan through hundreds of pages in a single flip",wheel
"Quick-Flip: A second wheel position on the left side of the device allows you to quickly flip between all open windows and documents, which is an excellent tool for me as a graphic designer",wheel
The scroll wheel is - interesting,wheel
"It rattles everywhere: the battery cover, the left and right mouse clickers, and the scroll wheel push button",wheel
"You can assign it to pressing the wheel in setpoint, but it is absolutely unreliable",wheel
"You cannot assign (and will not be capable in the future also, logitech support assures me)  middle click to left-wheel, right-wheel or ""one-touch search"" in setpoint (an ABSURD limitation, what where they thinking? [assign, be, assures, thinking] [capable, logitech, middle, left-wheel, right-wheel, one-touch]

"I have to say when I first got it I was very annoyed with it, there is this little button that sticks out right below the scroll wheel to toggle between smooth scrolling and contextual scrolling",wheel
Nice 2 button (3 if you click the wheel) mouse,wheel
"The wheel is nice and rugged with ""grips""",wheel
"The application switcher is a life saver, especially on Windows XP, and the dual mode scroll wheel is more useful than you can imagine",wheel
"My VX Revolution has 8 programable buttons, tilt wheel, cordless laser, and fast scrolling",wheel
"On the VX there was just a spring loaded slide on the top left that you could push forward or backward to zoom in and out, now it is one button above the thumb that you hold and move the mouse scroll wheel to zoom",wheel
They replaced this with the toggle button to have the mouse wheel click or free spin,wheel
"Hyper fast scrolling is very easy to get accustomed to, and now I cannot use any other mouse without the smooth wheel that can spin freely to scroll fast, especially in Outlook during email message list scrolling, or in the message itself",wheel
"I owned the MX Revolution before this; it was basically the same mouse but didn't have Unifying functionality (which I like) and had a second scroll wheel for the thumb, which I wasted on a volume control",wheel
"On THIS mouse, however, the button simply switches the ""mode"" of the scroll wheel from free-spin mode (very low friction, spins forever) to a more clicky mode, where the wheel stops quickly but only moves in discrete increments",wheel
"The MX Revolution (old model) had a software setting for this where if you spun the wheel faster than a certain (configurable) speed it would automatically go into free spin mode, and then revert back when the wheel started slowing down",wheel
"For normal use, click mode is pretty much the only way to use the scroll wheel, it is FAR too sensitive otherwise, even at 1-line scroll setting",wheel
"And if your finger even touches/bumps the wheel (not enough to make it ""click"" into a new position though), it will register as a scroll and zoom you in/out",wheel
"If anyone knows of custom drivers to let you mess with the scroll wheel sensitivity that'd be great, it's the only issue I have with the mouse but its very annoying",wheel
"I don't game much but the wheel is sensitive enough that in FPS games, if you scroll to select weapon, it will almost always scroll 3 or 4 weapons over instead of just 1, making it hard to play",wheel
I have to disable it to play anything that uses the scroll wheel as a secondary weapon swap button,wheel
I never scrolled 20000 line of codes top to bottom using scroll wheel earlier,wheel
"Problem is, this mouse shares a fatal design flaw with all Microsoft mice - you cannot assign other actions or keystrokes to the scroll wheel's horizontal (left-right) motion",wheel
"BTW, my scroll wheel toggle from free-spin to ratchet broke in about 2 weeks",wheel
I checked out the mouse in the store a year ago and it had a really nice scroll wheel,wheel
Pros: The scroll wheel is really nice,wheel
"The sensitivity and speed are nice when you're scrolling through a long web page, but it's so sensitive that it will register a 'scroll' and shift a web page just when you move the mouse without even touching the wheel",wheel
"well, it doesn't do cartwheel but the battery lasts and its pretty sensitive; it does everything my previous wired mouse did; reasonable in price; everything i could hope for in a mouse",wheel
The side flip and free rotate center wheel are major improvements,wheel
One of my biggest complaint is it takes a lot of effort to get the roller wheel to tilt left/right and it does not click to give you feedback that you've pressed it completely,wheel
"The scroll wheel is constructed of metal with a rubber-like ""tire"" around it",wheel
"Over time, it seems to have grown softer and now is slipping off the wheel when I try to tilt the wheel left or right to scroll in those directions",wheel
Over the past month or so the rubber has started to disintegrate - I can see small rubber particles clinging to the side and top of the wheel,wheel
The free-spinning scroll wheel alone makes it a very useful tool,wheel
"My last mouse, cordless laser also but fairly cheap, has fantastic software that lets you assign just about anything you want to not only the buttons/wheel, but also to combinations of buttons",wheel
"(Edit note: I did finally find how to do this, but the implementation is not apparent and doesn't work well with this scroll wheel)",wheel
If you deal with large documents and need the hightech scroll wheel (which works very well) then this is a great mouse,wheel
"My MX anywhere mouse seems more solid and better built, including the scroll wheel",wheel
"Regarding a couple of issues that other reviewers had, yes, the scroll wheel is completely smooth, with no clicks in it, so if that is a concern, then you might not like this mouse",wheel
After some experimenting I found that I can get it to work first time 90% of the time if I push the wheel a bit to the right while I'm clicking,wheel
"I love the mouse, especially because of battery durability, the tiny size of the receiver, the cute look, the smoothness of movement, the nice RF range, and the smooth scrolling wheel that I began to like",wheel
"The only gripe I have with it is that the scroll wheel is slightly slanted to the left, making right-side scrolling just a little trickier",wheel
"And even that doesn't work at times, therefore you end up wasting more time trying to scroll side to side with the wheel than if you had simply manually done it via the scroll bar itself",wheel
"For such an expensive mouse that has so few features on it, you'd think the scroll wheel would be much higher quality and better designed",wheel
And the scroll wheel is so deepy embedded in the mouse that it does not give you enough surface area to even move it,wheel
Changing the wheel from click-stop motion to smooth motion takes some getting used to,wheel
I am used to a wheel that scrolls smoothly and it doesn't matter to me one way or the other,wheel
"General pros/cons: + Construction/finish appear to be on par with Logitech's previous higher end products + Battery is user replaceable; standard rechargeable NiMH AA (Sanyo Eneloop) + Mouse can be operated in wired mode even with the battery removed + Uses the same ""hyper-fast scrolling"" scroll wheel as found on many other Logitech mice, can be switched from standard operation with detents for small movements to freewheel mode where the wheel spins freely allowing for very quick scrolling through large documents/web pages/etc",wheel
#NAME?,wheel
In place of the thumb wheel/button there is a button located in the portion of the mouse where the user's thumb rests on the left side of the Performance MX,wheel
"While this button is useful in its own right, the thumb wheel/button is one of the MX Revolution's best features",wheel
The biggest issue I have with the mouse is the removal of the thumb wheel; imagine having to,wheel
This arrangement also means there are only two options available to your thumb as opposed to three (no depressing the wheel),wheel
"However, recently the middle-wheel-click action has become annoyingly unreliable",wheel
"The weighted screen scroll wheel, something that I was not real excited about, is great, and I'm happy for having it",wheel
I am not much for thumb wheel and buttons,wheel

My only complaint is the free-spinning scrollwheel,wheel
"I want to play it in first person, but if the mouse jerks at all, it'll move the wheel enough to back me out to third person",wheel
"In the ""performance"" MX, as in the MX Revolution, there is a feature to switch the mouse between a ""free wheel"" scroll and a more conventional ""clicking"" scroll experience",wheel
on my MX Laser 1000) is the gentle center wheel left/right tilt (rocking) for horizontal scroll,wheel
"BTW, I've seen this mouse at brick-and-mortar shops and the wheel looked fine",wheel
"Pros: -High build quality -Lots of buttons -Spin wheel -precision sensor -fits hand well -usb/ac cable charge option = versatility -uses nimh batteries easily replaced -small usb reciever Cons: -thumb buttons are too high up on the mouse and require a reach -no dock -tilt buttons have no tactile feedback -no holder for usb reciever on mouse -cable bag doesn't have enough space for mouse as well -no auto profile switching as with g9 -zoom button right below forward and back thumb buttons, forward back are more important than zoom, but zoom gets in the way, you are likely to press it by accident, poor design choice",wheel
The best part of the MX Revolution was the auto-scroll wheel where after a certain speed of spinning the wheel it would go into a free-style spin,wheel
It was much better when it was automatic that you could set threshold for when you wanted the wheel to start free-spinning,wheel
I am disappointed overall with the mouse because i was hoping the task flip wheel / button whatever would speed up my production,wheel
I can program the buttons to do different things such as using the scroll wheel tilt feature to toggle my osnaps,wheel
"The problem is that it takes a great deal of effort to tilt the wheel, usually ending up in hitting the left or right mouse button and bringing up an unwanted command",wheel
"I'm a big ""wheel user"" for scrolling, and it's NOT a smooth scroll - it's like there's a ratchet/cog in there",wheel
"This, is in fact very cheap feeling - especially for someone like me that spends most of my working days opening and closing many tabs, in which clicking the scroll wheel to close a tab would only work effectively about 70% of the time",wheel
"My complaints are mainly about the buttons; this mouse has a lot of them (seven plus the wheel) and they're not all convenient to press when you want, or to not press when you don't",wheel
"The scroll wheel is nice, and there's a button to switch from ""ratcheted"" to ""smooth"" depending on your preference",wheel
"I can only assume it's the battery since the mouse seemed to work perfectly fine when I first purchased it, but it now consistently doesn't recognize clicks or scrolling of the wheel",wheel
"but I don't think I'll be trying another one, it really isn't a much better mouse than the Mx 1000, the only thing I liked more was the metal scroll wheel (which broke) and the pad design on the bottom of the mouse, which made for better movement on my mouse pad",wheel
I was in love with the scroll wheel and its ability to switch between frictionless and notched operations,wheel
The ability to switch between a click wheel and a smooth rolling wheel is very nice,wheel
"So is the ability to push the scroll wheel button left and right to pan a web window left and right, if the window isn't open wide enough",wheel
"-Firstly the middle button doesn't 'click', there seems to be an issue within the housing of the scroll wheel and the push sensor",wheel
"Unfortunately, because the surface is tilted, the scroll wheel needs to be too, but it's not",wheel
"The wheel on the 2nd one worked intermittently when rolled and also when clicked as a button, and the wheel on the 3rd one only worked as a middle button if I tilted it a little to the right (not too much though) before pushing on it",wheel
The scroll wheel has a smooth tactile feel to it,wheel
The size is nice for me and the buttons and the scroll wheel has a good feel,wheel
"2) the scroll wheel on top, if you spin it too fast, it will change scroll modes automatically",wheel
I like the scroll wheel with the separate button to allow quick scroll much better than the automatic approach used on the Revolution,wheel
"Mostly, i'd get confused when the wheel quit clicking on the old one",wheel
"The left and right mouse buttons deliver a crisp click, and all other buttons are just fine, my only mention is off the left and right 'scroll' buttons which are simply to lean the mouse wheel to either side",wheel
"So: all buttons assignable, great scroll wheel (although sometimes the fast scroll is",wheel
"Still wish the middle button (scroll wheel) had better haptics, but this mouse is otherwise a great bet, along with any other ""darkfield"" models",wheel
I have the wheel set so that it permanently runs friction free i,wheel
"- occasionally, about 3-4 times a week, the winxp sp2 pc crashes - complete and immediate shutdown (no blue screen) when I roll the wheel",wheel
"The multi-tap wheel for click or freespin is a great option, and the thumb wheel is nice once you get used to it",wheel
"The 4000 feels a lot more sturdy, but it's too hard to use the scroll wheel button so I never use the 4000",wheel
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I love the scroll wheel, the size is perfect for me (I have medium size hands) and it works on my jeans, my sofa and on the mouse pad very well",wheel
"I give it three stars overall because maybe the problem is inherent to my computer, on the other hand the Logitech is a great, intelligently designed mouse, the variable speed scroll wheel is a brilliant invention and once you get used to it nothing else satisfies, but overall three stars since the mouse just won't operate or function normally on a consistent basis",wheel
"It does have that extra wheel for the thumb, which is supposed to be used to switch between applications",wheel
I love the scroll wheel which can be used in ratchet-mode (clicks) or a practically frictionless flywheel,wheel
"Thumb wheel is sensitive - scrolls fwd/back but also depresses, and too often has my thumb bumped it and brought up the application change window",wheel
"It is by far the best hand fit that I have ever had, the most natural to use, and the most effective in its scrollwheel",wheel
The scrollwheel has that internal gear that lets you scroll in a controlled mode or in a free-wheeling mode,wheel
I find that I am a lot more productive since I have this thanks to the scrollwheel,wheel
The scroll wheel is awesome - and can be switched between modes in a click,wheel
"The scroll wheel works well, but it is the type that clicks, I was hoping it would have a smoother action to it, but I didn't have an out of box model to try out",wheel
"The scroll wheel has a button to either set in precision or free wheel mode, mine came from factory in free wheel",wheel
"What RUINS this mouse: - The stupid, sloppy, poorly made, difficult to re-map, overly sensitive, slippery scroll wheel",wheel
I've been using this mouse for a couple of days and I cringe every time I pick it up because it feels like the scroll wheel could have been pulled from a cheap hot-wheel car,wheel
"And it's not that I dislike the tilt-wheel feature, or the smooth scrolling",wheel
and there is an odd button just behind the top scroll wheel that is driving me crazy - poor design on that,wheel
The only complaint I have is that the wheel side scroll buttons are very hard to use when compared with my old MX1000 Logitech mouse,wheel
The MX1000's side scroll buttons are very positive feeling and the scroll wheel protruded more from the top of the mouse so using the side scroll function just worked,wheel
Make the scroll wheel better and it would be perfect,wheel
The center wheel also isn't as accurate as I'm used to,wheel
"The absolute best feature is the central scroll wheel; this invention is on par with Apple's magnetic power cable connector on their laptops, pure genius",wheel
"Another little annoyance is that whenever you wake your Mac up from sleep and the mouse comes to life again (with an audible 'chunk'), it always resets the scroll wheel setting back to 'line by line"" ratchet mode, instead of the smooth free spinning mode that I almost always use",wheel
Even the SCROLL wheel is a solid metal and allows you to switch from a smooth scroll to a more controlled clicking scroll by firmly pushing down on it,wheel
The unique feature of this mouse is the spin the scroll wheel without the  detents engaged (the wheel spins freely),wheel
The wheel has added inertia so a quick flip can get you through dozens of pages of a PDF or Word document or quickly down a long web page,wheel
"The concept is that if you give the wheel sufficient spin, the detent mechanism retracts and the wheel goes into free-spin mode and the detect action doesn't come back until it stops or you put your finger on it to stop",wheel
One is that my computer was not fast enough to keep up with the scrolling orders issued by the spinning wheel,wheel
It took quite a flip of the wheel to break out of the detent mode and that strong flip sent the wheel spinning faster than I wanted (hard to see the pages they are flipping buy at 5 or 10 per second),wheel
"The scrolling is nice, but when you press down on the scroll wheel, it does not click unless you are coming from a very specific angle that is not natural for how the mouse is angled",wheel
I found myself trying to press the scroll wheel and accidentally pressing the left button in addition or instead of middle button because of the extremely awkward angle,wheel
"2) The scroll wheel no longer makes any ""clicking"" sounds as you turn it, but at the same time, I do welcome the quietness of it, as I can scroll away without making ""grinding"" noises that potentially bother / irritate other people nearby",wheel
It is cumbersome to have to push down on the wheel before it will scroll the way I want it to,wheel
Can zoom with Ctrl+wheel in most programs,wheel
"Slightly larger than other Logitech mice I've used in past, getting comfortable with hand position has taken a while but the accuracy and function of buttons and wheel is superb",wheel
The buttons are well-placed and the scroll wheel action is smooth,wheel
"Also, the scroll wheel had a feature that wasn't obvious to me at first when I looked at the product online: there is a small button next to the scroll wheel which switches between normal scrolling found in other mice (where you hear a grinding noise as you scroll) and a smooth super-fast scrolling (with this, if you spin the scroll wheel fast, it just keeps scrolling freely on its own for a good couple of seconds before it stops!

"Basically the wheel goes from ""Click-click-click"" mode (like traditional mouse wheel) to a free-spinning mode that lets you fly through documents and webpages",wheel
"You can either have a button that switches, or you can actually configure a threshold where, if you spin the wheel hard enough, the mouse will actually switch all on it's own",wheel
It is easily the best feature I have had in a mouse since the advent of the scroll wheel itself,wheel
It can only be toggled between click-click mode and free mode using the button just below the scroll wheel,wheel
"So you have to resort to predicting that you are going to want the free-spin mode, hit the button, flick the wheel, then hit the button again to go back to click-click",wheel
The unit is taller and the scroll wheel is further from the back of the mouse than the old MX,wheel
"This review is not concerned with buttons (or whistles), but rather the ease of use, feel in the hand while working, and the degree of sensitivity of the vertical scroll wheel",wheel
The scroll wheel sensitivity on both the new Logitech Anywhere Mouse and the Logitech Performance Mouse MX are inferior to that found on their precursors,wheel
The default wheel page scrolling is set at about 80% of the fastest speed and is distractingly slow,wheel
"I find all the buttons and track wheel placement just fine, unlike some of the other commenters",wheel
"Also, the freewheel scroll mode sucks, it not accurate at all",wheel
"It's well designed, it looks good, it feels good in your hand, the scroll wheel is pure genius, but it just doesn't work consistently",wheel
The positions of the side buttons and side wheel are just about perfect,wheel
"The mouse does what it says on the box:  it's extremely comfortable, the additional buttons aid in productivity and the wheel's free-flowing option makes scrolling through docs and websites much easier",wheel
But the smooth-scrolling wheel that I thought I'd love,wheel
"The wheel doesn't have any ""clicks"" or ""notches"" as you scroll up & down, it's just a smooth, fluid motion",wheel
"This scroll wheel, as in most (if not all) cases, is also a middle-click button",wheel
"With a smooth-scrolling wheel, you have press it straight down, without letting it scroll in either direction while you're pressing it, or else the page you're viewing will move up or down, ever so slightly, and you miss the link you're trying to middle-click",wheel
"Also, the wheel used to go into ""free-spin"" mode when you rolled it quickly",wheel
"Lots of buttons, second wheel is amazingly useful",wheel
"This super-hyperactive scrollwheel alone is enough to dock this mouse a couple stars, but the rest of the mouse easily make up for it",wheel
"You DO, but you must go into the Logitech Control Center, go to the main scroll wheel's options, go to SmartShift, and select either start in click-to-click or start in free spin mode",wheel
"UPDATE: I wanted to post a quick update on this mouse, with regards to the ""hyperactive scroll wheel"" bit",wheel
"Despite the scroll wheel, I have never used a better mouse",wheel
"Pros: 1) awesome scroll wheel for lightning fast scrolling for long documents and the ability to stop on a dime when needed 2) rechargeable battery + battery gauge 3) super smooth teflon feet 4) configurable buttons and jog wheel 5) fairly accurate compared to an optical mouse 6) solid build quality of the housing 7) weight well, not too heavy, not too light Cons: 1) inconsistent travel for the buttons, sometimes the buttons stick 2) battery life could be better 3) logitech's software was horrendous (osx and windows) 4) choppy performance when there are other devices in the 2",wheel
"I have found I have to click the middle button slightly to the right at the perfect angle on the part of the wheel that's closest to me emerging from inside of the mouse, in order for it to even register a click",wheel
I bought this mouse because I thought the side wheel could be configured for horizontal scrolling,wheel
The other thing I noticed is when the top wheel is put into non-click mode it tends to pop back into click mode,wheel
If I had known the mouse didn't have a horizontal wheel I probably would have just purchased the MX600 which is also a very nice mouse at half the price,wheel
The left and right keys and the scroll wheel worked but that was all,wheel
"For those used to noisy scroll wheel, this mouse is silent",wheel
The super-fast vertical scroll wheel is much more useful then I would have thought,wheel
"You can also scroll horizontally by pushing the scroll wheel in the direction you want to scroll, another helpful function I take for granted now",wheel
The side scroll wheel actually allows you to scroll through your open applications,wheel
"The weighted ""flywheel"" scroll wheel is THE feature here - I don't like a lot of configurable buttons, but the scroll wheel is so excellent, it's easy to ignore some of those extra buttons",wheel
You just give the wheel a flick and you sail down long web pages and multi-page documents,wheel
Touch the wheel and it stops - couldn't be simpler or nicer,wheel
The Rev is nice but I miss the up/down buttons that were on the MX100 just above and below the wheel -- I wish the Rev had those buttons,wheel
"I realize the new scroll wheel is supposed to obviate the need for the up/down buttons, but so far I have my doubts",wheel
"When you press down on the Rev wheel, you switch between free-spin scroll and click scroll",wheel
"So what I'd really like is an MX1000, but with a wing at the right side of the base under the fingers and a wheel like the one on the Rev",wheel
"--No second scroll wheel --Using middle click on the top scroll wheel, the button barely registers and you have to click about 5x to actually get the middle click function to work",wheel
"If you install the intellipoint software that come up with this mouse, the wheel button click will show you all the applications in large tiles and you can select the one you want, thats very helpful for me",wheel
"the only thing i miss is the thumb wheel that came with the MX, but no big deal",wheel
"It has the normal left and right buttons, a scroll wheel which also clicks like a button, and it scrolls left and right for spreadsheet use",wheel
"This is a downside for me, although for some they may prefer the smooth scrolling versus a wheel that has a slight click(tick) as it rotates",wheel
they should raise the height of the scroll wheel back to where it was and they should bring back the distinctive click that existed for the MX1100 and MX Revolution mice,wheel
"The middle scroll wheel: The wheel features smooth scrolling, which is nice; however it is also mounted with a ridiculously stiff button mechanism",wheel
"Once it's finally adjusted to preference, the scroll wheel is pretty amazing",wheel
"It has an auto-shift feature (you can adjust or turn this off in the drivers) such that you can have a regular detent scroll, until you whip the wheel very fast up or down",wheel
"The first one of these I got had some problems -- the scroll wheel would sometimes scroll on its own and the middle-click would often not work, failing to click maybe 2/3 of the time",wheel
The splined scroll wheel was starting to drive me nuts while zooming in and out on a particular drawing,wheel
"It is configurable so the first thing that went away was the odd ""search"" button just south of the scroll wheel",wheel
"All said, the only really nice feature is the scroll wheel",wheel
"There are 3 main reasons why I prefer the MX 1100: 1) The MX 1100 is more comfortable than the Performance MX 2) The MX 1100 holds 2 AA batteries and lasts a really long time, so I never have to think about plugging in a charging cable And here's the big one: 3) The MX 1100 left/right side scrolling wheel clicks when you push it left and right, while the Performance MX wheel does not click #3 was enough to make me go back to the MX 1100 and start the RMA process instead of using this as an excuse to ""trade up""",wheel
The one semi-redeeming quality to the mouse was the scroll wheel,wheel
"The other thing about this mouse that could use improving is the scroll wheel, which is very sensitive and difficult to get a feel for whether you've 'scrolled' or not",wheel
"I gave this mouse three stars because for about the past week, my wheel either has not worked at all (it just spins around & does nothing) or I have to roll it to one side to get it to work",wheel
The biggest issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel,wheel
Another really big issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel,wheel
"(it is frictionless, by design) but then gives very little tactile feedback and is difficult to control, scrolling or  moving it around activates the scroll wheel inadvertently",wheel
"If press down on the scroll wheel, it does not click as you would expect and is hard to control because of its position, shape and feel",wheel
"Other reviews led me to believe the wheel would spin freely, rest assured it does offer SOME resistance",wheel
"Also, I would have liked a rubber scrollwheel instead of cheap plastic",wheel
"Also changed is the way the scroll wheel switches between ""bumpy"" to ""smooth"" (for a lack of better words) in a way it's improved because the scroll wheel on the old MX was a bit twitchy and wouldn't always cooperate",wheel
"Pros -Solid build -Smaller, Unifying receiver -Battery is now user replaceable -Have not experienced any lag yet -No more recharge dock, now uses a usb cable with a separate wall charger Cons -Zoom button is kind of close and too similar to the back/forward buttons, Sometimes I press it by accident when I try to press back -They got rid of my side wheel! [build, is, Have, experienced, uses, is, press, try, press, got] [Solid, Smaller, Unifying, replaceable, recharge, separate, close, similar, back\, rid]
",wheel
"Overall I don't regret making this purchase, I like the mouse and the accessories that came with it and feel that there are improvements, but I want my side wheel back! [do, regret, making, like, came, feel, are, want] [Overall]
",wheel
#NAME?,wheel
"Good features including scroll wheel, charging, and support of Mac OS X",wheel
The scroll wheel seems to be a much cheaper mechanism,wheel
The scroll wheel on the Revolution MX mouse has a nice movement and clicks when moved to the left or right (sideways scroll) whereas the Performance MX mouse doesn't seem to be moving at all and doesn't give any feedback when moved to the left or right,wheel
The MX Revolution has an electronic scroll wheel can be pressed or scrolled quickly to toggle between smooth scrolling and click scrolling and has a programmable button just behind the scroll wheel,wheel
The Performance MX has a cheaper mechanical scroll wheel and the programmable button on the MX Revolution is now the smooth scroll/click scroll switch,wheel
"Of course, the MX Revolution scroll wheel can be programmed per application so it's nice to have the mouse magically switch itself to smooth scrolling when I switch to Internet Explorer or Firefox and back to click scrolling when I switch to another application",wheel
"( I am a gamer ) My only issue, and a very small one, is the middle mouse wheel does not click in very smoothly",wheel
"For scrolling it is just fine, but you cannot count on key binding the wheel ""click"" as it is for lack of a better term : clunky",wheel
"The mouse has a nice feel to it, but it is a bit small for my hand and can cause cramping when using the wheel much, as the length of the mouse is such that you have to pull your fingers back to reach the buttons and wheel comfortably",wheel
"The side button do not work or are sporadic in their operation, and the scroll wheel stops unlocking to allow for free scroll, or vice versa",wheel
"Lastly, the wheel is not ""clicky"" as the older model and much tighter",wheel
Loved the heavy scroll wheel while it lasted,wheel
"The bad: - What made the MX Revolution revolutionary was the smooth wheel scrolling, which could be activated by a customized ""SmartShift"" setting - spin it fast, and it'll switch to smooth scrolling mode automatically",wheel
"(See addendum at end) Some people decry the loss of the side rocker wheel, but personally, I never found it to be a useful feature on the MX Revolution",wheel
"Regardless, that wheel served as three buttons (rock forward, back, or press), which have been replaced by the single thumb button that I really like",wheel
"For those of you that don't know quite what I mean; you know how you can down click the scrollwheel on most and then just use the mouse to change which direction? [do, know, mean, know, click, use, change] [most]
",wheel
"Well, it's often very easy to down-click the scrollwheel when you don't want to",wheel
The only con is that I wish there were a thumb wheel that allowed scrolling,wheel
I have Firefox setup so I just click the wheel left or right to switch open tabs,wheel
"The notches on the scroll wheel have too much play on them, causing each discrete 'notch' of scroll to actually scroll 2 or even 3 lines",wheel
"Its left mouse button is starting to die, but it still has rock-solid click-by-click scrolling - each notch of the scroll wheel is always exactly one line of movement",wheel
The scroll wheel DOES have great tracking,wheel
"If you switch to free scroll mode, you can move precisely one line up or down with the wheel, but then you don't get the tactile feedback that you do with the notches",wheel
"That tactile feedback is important in, for example, an FPS game where you use the scroll wheel to quickly switch between weapons",wheel
I use the middle click button in scroll wheel to open links in browsers in new tabs,wheel
The scroll wheel in this mouse doesn't have a middle click button,wheel
It changes the scrolling from a ratcheted wheel to a smooth/loose wheel (Free Spin),wheel
"Nice to get a closer look in some applications of text or objects, but then again the main scroll wheel is used for that anyway in most programs",wheel
A good way to ensure good positioning is to put your middle finger on the scroll wheel and your thumb on the zoom lever,wheel
(UPDATE: I've figured out how to get a middle click on the scroll wheel,wheel
"tilt wheel/side to side scrolling, customizable buttons, and easily-accessible forward/back buttons for fast and efficient web browsing), but for basic functionality, this mouse simply cannot be beaten",wheel
The soft-touch buttons and scroll wheel are also amazingly easy on the hand when doing a ton of repetitive movements,wheel
"- Now, after just over a month of use, the free-spin wheel mode doesn't work as it should",wheel
It's the worst wheel on any mouse I've used in the past ten years,wheel
"ONE THING: the scroll wheel is a little loud for use at work; if I scroll through pages quickly, I'm a little self-conscious about the ratcheting sound",wheel
"(1) The scroll wheel they hype so much is very hard to get used to, and it does respond to changes in the preferences",wheel
"(2) The side wheel, which allows you to quickly change applications, is physically hard to use because the mouse want to slip when you use it",wheel
"The scroll wheel is very smooth, and easy to use, side clicking is nice, very little force required",wheel
"The scroll wheel is very smooth, in fact, too smooth",wheel
"I currently use a Logitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse (for notebooks), and that is what I'm comparing alot of the features such as buttons and scroll wheel to",wheel
first it was the MX1000 that had a defective scroll wheel button that only clicked 1 out of 3 times,wheel
one feature i do love is the free scrolling scroll wheel,wheel
"All in all, the buttons feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel",wheel
My logitech keyboard/mouse combo my work has feels better in the wheel department,wheel
Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works,wheel
"The scroll wheel is nice, though the free-spin feature is not as useful as I thought it would be",wheel
"(It is far faster to press CTRL-END to go the end of a long document, rather than spin the wheel for seconds on end",wheel
I have no idea why they would make such a nice mouse and skimp on the scroll wheel,wheel
"The big selling point of the MX Revolution is, of course, its scroll wheel",wheel
"Sometimes the middle-click switch doesn't quite recognize that you want to switch modes, so you have to press the wheel a bit more firmly to get it to switch modes (presumably to differentiate the middle button from the tilt-wheel buttons)-- Logitech's newer MX1100 has a toggle switch that's easier to use, and works even when the mouse is turned off",wheel
"While the overall design is great and the scroll wheel is very slick, there are two things I find myself never using: the zoom button and the document flip wheel",wheel
"I suppose I could assign middle-click to the zoom button assuming SetPoint allows this, but even then I wouldn't use it very often, since I'm so used to using the left hand to hold down Ctrl (on PCs) or Option (on Macs) while turning the scroll wheel",wheel
"Evidently Logitech found the MX Revolution's scroll wheel to be a smash success and is including it in much of their lineup, so users may want to try newer models like the MX1100 and G500",wheel
"======EDIT--- After using both mice (5000 and 6000) for a very long time I have found that, over time, debris gets stuck inside of the wheel and causes friction when moving the mouse wheel",wheel
"Fit and finish are excellent, with the only two niggles I have are with the shape of the mouse and the non-tilting scroll wheel",wheel
"The real reason that this mouse is so expensive is its clutch-based wheel, which is handy but brittle - mine broke after a couple months of use, and every store display model I have seen is broken as well",wheel
"Plus the position where they put one of the new buttons, right below the scroll wheel, and as small as they can make it",wheel
"Now the fast scroll wheel feature they added, nice concept on paper & it sounds great",wheel
"I've scoured the net hoping to find a wireless rechargeable mouse that has a nice smooth scrolling wheel, that has decent programmable button features, and all I came up with was the G700 - which is way too complex for my needs, and the Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Mac",wheel
"**** Good 4-fuzzies feature ratings: **** When using the left/right mouse buttons and scroll wheel, both the 6000 and Explorer Mini Mouse are two of the most whisper-quiet mice that I have ever used, with barely audible clicking sounds coming from the mouse buttons",wheel
"*** Not-so-good 3-fuzzies feature ratings: *** On both this 6000 mouse and the Explorer Mini Mouse, clicking down on the scroll wheel to use it as the middle mouse button requires far too much force, and it makes a loud clunky clicking sound, which tends to negate the really quiet nature of the left/right buttons and the silent scroll wheel",wheel
)  The 6000's scroll wheel is coated with a rubber compound and the Explorer Mini Mouse's scroll wheel has slight ridges covering it for traction,wheel
"But neither of these two mice provide for the incremental ""cogwheel"" rolling effect that you may have become accustomed to on other mice",wheel
"So as I roll my finger over the scroll wheel back and forth, I do not feel that there is ever a subjectively precise control exerted over how much I am rolling that scroll wheel since my finger does not receive any tactile feedback as I roll the scroll wheel",wheel
The only advantage of the new wheel is that it works under Apple's OSX,wheel
It seems weird that they would abandon such a neat concept as the original hyper-scrolling wheel,wheel
"It's mostly programmable, and I like the click wheel toggle for smooth or notched experiences when scrolling",wheel
The only problem I have with it is the scroll wheel (after 7 months of intense use) doesn't always scroll the page,wheel
"Be sure to check out the free-spinning wheel, which I discovered only by accident",wheel
"Just give the wheel a really hard flick and it starts spinning like a frisbee, and down (or up) you go at warp speed (pardon the mixed metaphor)",wheel
"I also really like the idea of the thumb wheel, which is why I bought the mouse to begin with; it seemed a good successor to the MX700's conveniently placed scroll up and scroll down buttons, which I use all the time",wheel
This mouse is very smooth and nice to use the only complaints are even though the scrolling wheel is the smoothest I have ever used it does not feel very durable,wheel
The free or indexed spin of the middle (top) wheel is very nice,wheel
Its comfortable in my hand and one of my absolute favorite features is the clutch for the mouse wheel,wheel
"Add in all the other functionality that is so great, like a unlocking scroll wheel so you can fly through the page faster than anything you've ever seen, and it's a great performer as well",wheel
i frequently have to press the scroll wheel down multiple times for the button to be recognized,wheel
The MX Revolution had a button on the top just below the wheel that served as the One-Touch Search button,wheel
"That button on the Performance MX is now a ""gear shifter"" that changes the wheel from click-to-click like a standard mouse wheel to a wheel that spins freely so that you can move up and down long pages quickly",wheel
I never used the freely spinning wheel feature on the MX Revolution anyway because I use a Firefox add-on called FireGestures which is far more useful and efficient for my purposes,wheel
The wheel is angled towards the index finger,wheel
While that angle makes for easy and comfortable wheel scrolling it took some time to adjust to clicking the wheel since the wheel needs to be pressed in at that 75 degree angle,wheel
What's worse is the scroll wheel,wheel
A couple main gripes are they removed the side thumb wheel and the top wheel's free spin settings are more limited in preferences,wheel
"Smooth scrolling or ""bumpy resistance"" wheel is nice - I like having that option with a quick click of a button",wheel
"Windows 7 didn't seem to install all the appropriate drivers, just the ones to get it working as a basic mouse (movement, wheel, front/back buttons), just not the extra thumb button",wheel
"I've owned three of these mouses over the last year and they all had one recurring issue:  after several months, the mouse wheel becomes sticky",wheel
"It would become difficult to turn the mouse wheel, and I eventually have to manually cut out the rubber part of the mouse wheel in order to keep it rolling smoothly",wheel
"The wheel is great, I'm continuing to use the mouse, but the rest of the buttons are mostly useless",wheel
"The mouse usability is okay, although i dislike the manual button to switch the scroll wheel from freewheel to clicky wheel",wheel
The result is depressing the scroll wheel to go to your search engine of choice often goes to the setup menue and requires more depressing to get to the correct function,wheel
This would get 5 stars except for the fact that after owning it for a couple of months the elastic over the scroll wheel gets stretched out and effectively kills the scrolling capabilities of the mouse,wheel
"The mouse is fantastic, sensitive, comfortable, works on most surfaces like it says, however if Microsoft does not re-engineer the scroll wheel my next mouse will not be this one",wheel
"And it accelerates, meaning that you can scroll a page in a browser or in an Office application at normal speeds and then if you need to get back to the top of the page quickly you can spin it hard and it will ""free-wheel"" and get there in a split second",wheel
"My fingers should slide easily over the surface, the buttons should be comfy and smoothly contoured, and I should naturally find the buttons and wheel in a convenient location",wheel
"The shape of this mouse IS nice and comfy, and the thumb rest is nice, (though the MX 1000 thumb rest is smaller, it's more than adequate) but I find the buttons and scroll wheel to be awkward, and in the case of the forward/back buttons, actually uncomfortable to press",wheel
"The main left and right buttons are unexceptional (which is fine), but it's the scroll wheel and ""search"" button that really irritate me",wheel
"The scroll wheel has two modes, both of which are bothersome",wheel
"I'm not certain if I'm in the majority here, but I also use my scroll wheel as a middle click - and quite extensively",wheel
"The wheel is quite stiff to press and is made this way intentionally because it is intended to be used to shift between the two scroll modes, something you probably don't want to do accidentally while scrolling",wheel
"Since the scroll wheel was completely unusable as a middle click, I decided to reconfigure the ""search"" button to serve this purpose",wheel
"While I must admit this is much better than the middle-clunk offered by the scroll wheel, it is set just too far forward on the mouse to enable comfortable middle-clicking",wheel
From the beginning the scroll wheel was a love/hate affair,wheel
"When it doesn't it is a major pain, with no click or tactile feedback and moving the screen irregularly in response to the wheel",wheel
It is always the same screens that make the wheel lose track of itself,wheel
"The only thing worse than the scroll wheel and unresponsive zoom control is the rude, non-existent support",wheel
"The free wheel mode allows you to go through huge document so easily, this is incredible",wheel
"The dynamic, ""whirl"" style of scroll wheel should become mandatory on all mice",wheel
"After using it for a while, I'm finding that the wheel turns freely, on it's own",wheel
I am happy that this mouse has retained its simplicity of 2 buttons and a scroll wheel/button,wheel
"Ive set all the extra buttons to the following for autocad; lower thumb:open, left scroll wheel:escape, right scroll: mute (just in case my boss has something to say), zoom:save, i set the thum up/down to move through the last commands (handy for when you want to go back 2 or three commands real quick), and right click: repeat last command (i prefer it to the spacebar for repeat)",wheel
Because of the slight angle the wheel sits (it leans slightly to the left) it's easy to inadvertently hit left scroll when you center click,wheel
"Now, if you have larger hands you will find the mouse wheel and thumb up/down buttons too close",wheel
The big plus the M705 has it the scroll wheel has the physical left and right scroll click and isn't as sensitive so you wont accidentally hit it while middle clicking,wheel
"the spin wheel has two modes, a normal click to click and a free spin mode",wheel
"there are also three more button, a one touch search located just behind the first wheel and two arrow buttons on the side by the second wheel",wheel
"The button behind the wheel (Search button) would be a perfect place for a middle click, but alas, you can't assign that function to that button",wheel
"Also, the side wheel/document switcher, since it is no better than Alt+Tab, will not let you switch between Firefox tabs",wheel
The second is the middle wheel button on the mouse,wheel
"After a month's worth of usage, I have to say the worst part of this mouse is the scrolling wheel",wheel
"It's sensitive, but I use to mostly to open tabs in firefox and to press this wheel down, it's takes quite a bit of force in comparison to any of the mouse i've ever used in my life, other than those silly first generation ones",wheel
You are not able to turn you middle wheel to left-right as it supposed to be,wheel
"On the cons side, I would have liked to have the wheel on the mouse actually click when you move it rather than just a smooth movement",wheel
"Personally, I think a good mouse wheel needs a tactile click-click-click feeling but this one's (I purchased three at once based on good reviews) wheel is so fluid that it might as well be greased",wheel
1) The spin wheel is great but that is all,wheel
I taped over the lazer and now just use it as a sping wheel for my left hand while I use my microsoft mouse in my right hand,wheel
This mouse clicks reasonably quietly and the wheel is quiet as well,wheel
Apparently the scrolling rate is sensitive to the tilt of the wheel - of course it won't run off whatever Win 7 installs automatically,wheel
"The mouse worked perfectly, the wheel button also works perfectly, unlike the buttons on my replacement notebook optical laser mouse 6000",wheel
This mouse also has a better wheel button (good for middle clicking) than the newer laser mouse 6000 which is erratic,wheel
"The wheel scrolling, and mouse positioning on the newer laser mouse 6000 is better than this mouse",wheel
"Scroll wheel is supposed to also be a middle button according to the brochure, I but could not get it to work",wheel
"The 5000 is better when it comes to buttons and wheel placement and functioning, the 6000 MIGHT start a bit faster but that's hard to tell for sure",wheel
The mouse wheel is smooth in the backwards motion but clunks when changing direction to a forward motion,wheel
"By default, clicking the middle button swaps the scrolling of the wheel",wheel
"The side-scroll function has excessive wheel displacement in the right and left direction and too little resistance, and is also inadvertently activated when attempting to use middle click",wheel
Smooth scroll wheel makes for imprecise scrolling,wheel
"SUMMARY: If you use the scroll wheel for anything other than pure vertical scrolling, then this mouse is not for you",wheel
The scroll wheel are so smooth,wheel
Pros: The scroll wheel is nice,wheel
The 'air wheel' takes getting used to but thats not the main issue,wheel
"The sides of the mouse are wrapped in a soft rubber material, and the wheel appears to be covered in the same material",wheel
"There are a total of 4 standard buttons, with a scroll wheel button and 4-way scrolling",wheel
"The scroll wheel does not offer any ""clicks"", which is similar to the click-free setting with the Logitech G9x",wheel
The Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook 5000 scroll wheel button is about as easy to use as the primary/secondary buttons,wheel
"What Microsoft should do is reduce the force required to push the scroll wheel button, and add the clicking/gears so it is easier to use",wheel
"Microsoft should pay attention to the scroll wheel though, since we're using it more and more with tabbed browsing",wheel
"The rocking feature, MicroGear Scroll Wheel, is out of my expectation as it is the mouse driver which decide whether the wheel to go smoothly or click-to-click instead of you",wheel
The second wheel which is besides your thumb in fact take up the space of your thumb,wheel
Just click the center button over the mouse wheel and the scroll wheel goes free,wheel
It will only work fine if it is pressed from the center top of the wheel,wheel
"I also give the smooth-scroll wheel, side selector, and even quick-search button high marks",wheel
The worse part is the scrollwheel,wheel
"Also, using the side scrolling function is effortless like it should be simple because the wheel does not rise far enough out of the Mouse's body",wheel
"The ""hyper-scroll"" feature is nice - what I didn't realize prior to purchasing it is that you can go back and forth between and indexed scroll (like most other mice) and the hyper scroll which allows the wheel to spin freely - basically, with one quick flick of the wheel in hyper-scroll mode, you can scroll down (for example) 3,000 rows in Excel within about 5 seconds",wheel
"the ""down-graded"" version of the software does not let you configure the scroll wheel on your thumb, nor the 2 buttons on the side of the mouse next to your thumb, so I'm stuck with a nice-feeling, cool-looking wireless mouse that doesn't really have any more functionality that the other mice on the market",wheel
"The buttons feel flimsy and weird, unlike another other mice I tried: logitech, microsoft intellimouse/wheelmouse/basic mouse",wheel
the wheel of the mouse is just not good enough to be usable,wheel
"My old mouse was pretty plain -- it had two buttons and a scroll wheel, all of which worked pretty much exactly as one would expect",wheel
"The scroll wheel scrolled at an acceptable speed, and also doubled as a middle mouse button",wheel
"It would be nicer if it you could just click the thumbwheel, select the application, and then click the thumbwheel again or the right click to select",wheel
"In general, I have mixed feeling about the scroll wheel",wheel
"I would give this mouse easily a 5 star, but the only problem i have with it the wheel, when you the driver install the mouse wheel click, allows you to switch windows, just like alt + tab, but i use the wheel click to open new tabs in my browser, that is pretty easy to change for the wheel click to do that, but i hate the wheel because it free spins and doesnt have the little clicks when you spin it, making it a bit hard to control how much you scroll",wheel
"I got this mouse for my notebook because it was one of the few mice available that met my 3 requirements: tilt wheel, thumb button(s), and a micro receiver",wheel
so when viewing pictures in my picture viewer with the scroll wheel it skips 1-2 pictures every time I scroll up/down,wheel
"OTHER THOUGHTS: If you're looking for a nice mouse for your notebook and you don't mind not being able to customize the tilt wheel or number of lines the wheel scrolls and you don't mind the side buttons being too far forward, this mouse is a good choice",wheel
The scroll wheel (and/or its underlying mechanism) is poorly built and undependable,wheel
"I blew some compressed air into the crevices around the wheel, and it grudgingly, hesitatingly started to work (first it would only scroll one line per revolution, then slowly more & more until it was back to normal)",wheel
"In a fit of anger, I pressed down on the scroll wheel with the edge of my hand and scrolled it up & down like a mad man",wheel
"I don't know what's wrong with this stupid mouse - I haven't dropped it, I don't work in a dusty old attic or a sawmill or anything, and I have a general policy of not dipping my finger in liquids or gooey substances before attempting to use the scroll wheel",wheel
I always found the typical clicking scroll wheel on other mice so annoying,wheel
"The problem lies in the scroll wheel when you scroll, the position changes a few instead of one click to one scroll",wheel
The only complaint I have is the scroll wheel,wheel
"No matter how slow I have it programmed, when you turn the wheel, it ""jumps"" down the page",wheel
"The jog side wheel or whatever they call it on the left side provides a very quick way to move from one open app to another, the more conventional wheel on the top clicks through pages or spins through them like moving over the ground in a fast, low flying plane",wheel
The scroll wheel located between the main buttons is really a flywheel,wheel
Clicking the wheel will toggle between a smooth scroll and a ratchetting scroll but both are capable of speed,wheel
This is a wheel-like button on the side,wheel
If the scroll wheel had an odometer it would have probably rolled back over to zero more than a couple times (I'm scroll wheel happy on webpages),wheel
"The rest of course are simple things like fiber-optic, scroll wheel, and wireless",wheel
Since I am an Architect and use the mouse wheel to pan and zoom this was posing a major problem,wheel
"Oh yeah, this mouse's software has a tendency to forget how many clicks the scroll wheel's set to",wheel
The wheel also has a nice grip to it as well,wheel
"The problem, and this is a major flaw in my opinion, is the scroll wheel! [is, is] [major]
",wheel
"It is VERY sensitive, I will be web browsing and just accidentally bump it and my page jerks from the scroll wheel, and don't even get me started on trying to use it for gaming",wheel
As a result I've had to set the mouse scroll wheel sensitivity in Windows setting to almost the bare minimum which is rather frustrating when I DO want to scroll because I have to turn the wheel more to get the same result as other mouses,wheel
If the scroll wheel had incremental clicks like EVERY mouse has this would easily be a 5 star review,wheel
PROS: BlueTrack-It works on almost all surfaces Smooth scroll wheel- You get to exactly where you want to be on a page,wheel
"It's solid, well-constructed, the wheel works great, and so on",wheel
The wheel on the side and the search button are mostly worthless,wheel
The scroll wheel in either manual or free-spin mode is the best I've ever felt,wheel
"Although I do like the ""shifting"" aspect of the wheel between free-spin and manual mode, it becomes very annoying to have this automatically shift based on Logitech's interpretation of which mode I want to use and when",wheel
This is particularly annoying because it's very easy to get used to keeping it in free spin mode because it is so convenient only to find that you often have to switch out of it to get the wheel to work at all,wheel
"At other times, when I activate the free-spin mode, the scroll effect takes off like it's on its own mission and just madly keeps scrolling up or down without responding to any clicks (left, right or on the wheel itself) until it has decided where to go on its own, anywhere between 3 to 5 seconds after I've given up trying to stop it",wheel
I think this might be related to a design flaw in this mouse related to the restrained or unrestrained scroll wheel feature,wheel
"As far as the crazy new scroll wheel goes, yea it's nice",wheel
I think that the build quality of the mouse and how SOLID the wheel feels is a far better selling point,wheel
One thing I absolutely love about the current Logitech line is the alloy scroll-wheel which really gives scrolling a solid feel,wheel
"I'm sure every mouse maker's going to move to alloy wheel, because it's far superior",wheel
"And the Logitech line has this ultimate-free-wheeling scroll feature, where you can turn off the wheel friction and let it fly",wheel
"No more scrolling down a whole forum page when you know that what you want is on the bottom, just release the wheel-friction and let it fly",wheel
"However, like some people I don't like the low resistance of the scroll wheel",wheel
The nice feature of this mouse--as everyone else reports--is the frictionless scrollwheel,wheel
"If you have small hands, go for the LX ""laptop"" version that is cheaper and doesn't put an annoying rubber wheel where you want to rest your thumb",wheel
In fact the only con that I have is the scrolling wheel broke after only owning this mouse for 2 months,wheel
"There is one problem using the middle click and the wheel: when you click the wheel to have a middle click, the wheel reports a scrolling and this move the window content",wheel
"Disabling ""smooth scrolling"" from Setpoint makes the wheel and the middle click work well (thanks to S",wheel
The scroll wheel is free rolling without ratcheting and feels rather good to use,wheel
It does not spin the same way as the advanced Logitech scroll wheel does however,wheel
There is also low battery indicator just below the scroll wheel than blinks red when your battery is low,wheel
"In a single line: The scroll wheel of this mouse is CRITICALLY bad, and I would recommend against buying it if you like fast-smooth scroll or the left-right rocker buttons on the scroll-wheel",wheel
The Side-to-Side buttons (Left/Right) for the scroll wheel are too sensitive,wheel
"Even after I stop the wheel from spinning with my finger, just releasing it from the pressure of my finger tip spins it a few more lines",wheel
"It's a bit big and bulky, but the idea of a rechargeable mouse, the smart-shifting scroll wheel, the thumb lever, and the other advanced features (several programmable buttons, laser precision, etc",wheel
"The software was better at controlling it than I was (using the software to force it to switch always worked, but manually pressing the wheel was hit-or-miss)",wheel
"In its marketing materials, Logitech boasts about the complexity of the mechanism that achieves the scroll-wheel switching",wheel
"However, the functions that were available were either redundant (""go back"" and ""go forward,"" which the side buttons already do, or scrolling functions, which the scroll wheel already does) or just not terribly useful",wheel
"This should have been a cool feature, as it allows you to make program-level adjustments such as setting the scroll wheel to remain always ratcheted in Excel but switch between ratcheted and frictionless in Word, and so forth",wheel
"You can click the center wheel to change the feel of the scroll wheel, which is cool",wheel
Using the scroll wheel pages scroll by at blindingly fast speeds or painfully slow,wheel
Because of the wheel where your thumb should be resting if you have larger hands the mouse is extremely uncomfortable to use,wheel
"I like most everything 'bout this mouse, but when I try to lock in auto-scroll using the wheel pushbutton, it depends on where the wheel is on its full rotation as to how much luck I have doing so",wheel
"Experimenting, I also notice, depending on position of the wheel when auto-scroll is locked in, you can either give the top of the mouse a relatively hard thump or almost breathe on it to knock it out of auto-scroll",wheel
"Based on a few reviews I've read where other folks seem to be complaining 'bout the wheel pushbutton in other applications, it sounds like this may be an endemic problem with this model? [Based, 've, read, seem, be, complaining, sounds, be] [few, other, other, endemic]
",wheel
"It would also be nice if the wheel clicks where a little more definitive-compared to other mice I've used, the individual clicks seem to be a little vague",wheel
"For instance, there is not a separate setting for scroll speed with the logitech software, so I have to compromise with the setting between the trackpad (which I want slower) and the mouse wheel (which I want faster)",wheel
"I also have a minor issue with the scroll wheel: when I place my finger on it and scroll as far down as I can with one scroll then stop, the scrolling sometimes jumps back up on the screen a ways",wheel
"The mouse is accurate, I love the free-spinning scroll wheel, (it continues to spin as if on a needle bearing), All the assignable buttons, It's heft, It's fit in my hand, the tiny size of the USB dongle, It works smoothly on most surfaces",wheel
"I had to adjust my mouse settings in Control Panel, but I think that's because laser mice are more sensitive than wheel mice",wheel
"Minus a star for its size (which I should have researched more) and a minor annoyance with the scroll wheel (a little sensitive to clicks), really good mouse",wheel
Here are the differences: - There used to be a button at the bottom of the top wheel that was supposed to be a search button or something like that,wheel
#NAME?,wheel
"I would bet that this is not a big one for many people, but I found the side wheel useful",wheel
"It wasn't a real wheel as such, but more like three buttons (up, down and press)",wheel
"On the defective mouse, the scroll wheel worked, the right button worked intermittently, but the pointer wouldn't move",wheel
Avoid if you use the middle mouse wheel a lot,wheel
There is a button to change the scroll wheel from fast to slow and this is good,wheel
"I really like the side scroll feature, and the smooth wheel scrolling feature is very nice once you get it adjusted to your preference (not hard to do, just takes a minute)",wheel
I would like to have the wheel full function though,wheel
"Only enhancements I would recommend are: on the fly dpi switches (like the G7), wheel button returned (probably hard to do with the free fly wheel technology), search button Firefox friendly (opens 2 tabs for each search), and more features! [recommend, are, returned, do, opens] [free, friendly]
",wheel
This would get 5 stars if it wasn't for a gimpy scroll wheel,wheel
I have no idea why they would make such a nice mouse and skimp on the scroll wheel,wheel
There is no tactile resistance at all and its just a free wheeling scroll,wheel
"The third is about the scroll wheel/software/ my software? [is, wheel\] [third]
",wheel
"With the software I changed the ""quick search"" button (the one behind the scroll wheel) to show the desktop and turned the thumb rocker into an alt-tab replacement",wheel
"I also set the scroll wheel to always be free flowing, as opposed as being able to click and switch between normal and free flowing, so I could use the ""click"" to be a middle button which is useful to open up another tab in a web browser by middle clicking a link",wheel
"The only downside would be the scrolling wheel, it's hard to tell when it's actually scrolling",wheel
"Secondly, the scroll wheel that everyone is so in love with is good for fiddling with if you have to read through a long, tedious document, but as for actually navigating that document or a lengthy web page, the flywheel thing is more of a gimmick than a useful feature",wheel
"Also, I have never had a non-click wheel mouse before and now that I have, I think I may like it better",wheel
"My fianc&eacute; uses the Anywhere Mouse MX and I was delighted by the design of the wheel; you clicked the wheel to change the scrolling speed, and clicked the button below the wheel for a center-button click",wheel
"The mouse still works great if you just use it like a normal mouse; HOWEVER, if you use the middle button (pressing down on the scroll wheel) a lot for games/opening in tabs, DO NOT get this mouse because you really have to push on the scroll wheel for it to click",wheel
"- The middle button being more responsive on the PMX doesn't matter because you can assign the button below the scroll wheel as the middle button on the MXR and you can't assign that on the PMX, it's stuck as the button to switch hyper-scrolling",wheel
"- Extra thumb button not really useful unless you are a gamer (again, wireless is not made for gaming) - 2nd ""wheel"" is removed",wheel
Only 2 buttons (thumb and zoom) replaced the wheel which is bascially 3 buttons and has more practical use because it's all on one wheel,wheel
Everything else works great like the 3500 EXCEPT the mouse wheel,wheel
"The wheel is supposed to be super smooth scrolling, but what it means is that it is so sensitive that even just moving the mouse around makes the wheel slide ever so slightly up and down, which means the web page you are looking at just randomly ticks up or down",wheel
"Also, forget about using the mouse-wheel button",wheel
"A solid mouse, with all the basic features (which to me include mouse wheel as a 3rd button click, USB receiver as the on/off switch), and good design and quality",wheel
"Works great, scroll wheel got dropped on, and it's not as smooth as it used to be",wheel
One of the coolest features is the scrolling wheel,wheel
"If will change from the click type scroll wheel to a free scrolling wheel that can spin freely for a few seconds per spin! [change, spin] [free, few]
",wheel
And for on the fly adjustments you can use SetPoint to make clicking the scroll wheel in switch between free scrolling/click modes,wheel
Another cool button is the side wheel,wheel
The top button is placed underneath the top scroll wheel,wheel
"the one thing that's a bit ""different"" is that the scroll wheel does not have the ""click click"" feel to it as it is turned like all other mouses have had for years but one will get used to that",wheel
"Button location, not the same as the Revolution, looks similiar but you have to really move your fingers to engage the side buttons which is important when doing production work, not being able to program the button behind the wheel and its sensitive right and left buttons made it impossible to use with Autocad",wheel
The thing I love about it is the free-spinning scroll wheel,wheel
"I plan to replace it with either an ergonomic mouse or a trackball, but I am definitely going to find something with a free-spinning scroll wheel",wheel
"After changing the very bottom button to zoom in on print, you press the bottom button, then scroll with the scroll wheel in order to enlarge or compress photos or print size",wheel
The wheel does not tilt to the left/right very well making it a bit difficult to use that feature,wheel
There are times that the fact that the touch pad is still active while the mouse is in use that the touch pad will reposition the pointer at the slightest brush and it's infuriating,pointer
#NAME?,pointer
"When I tested it against my other mouse (a relatively new, full-sized Microsoft model without ""BlueTrack""), this one was noticeably smoother (pointer movement) and it made my other mouse seem jerky and primitive",pointer
"It may seem a bit childish but after purchasing a name brand mouse and having it perform like a china made import in addition to having to go back to the integrated laptop pointer, to say the least I was a bit upset",pointer
"With ""enhance pointer precision"" on in win XP, the speed ramp seems to be a lot steeper than with my old mouse",pointer
"While the mouse itself had great pointer response and moved very nicely on my desk, the scroll wheel is what ended the relationship for me",pointer
"While the pointer was quick to respond to movements, and accurate, the obnoxiously large ""receiver"" that has to plug into a USB port easily gets its signal blocked",pointer
"For example, I would like to see a numeric keypad and also a presentation/pointer that could work with the unifying receiver - logitech makes both such devices now, but they won't work with the unifying receiver",pointer
"The pointer motion is very accurate and smooth, scrolling is excellent, and conveniently placed thumb keys that are actually useful (just like my old ComfortOptical 3000)",pointer
"Problems on my older Mac: 1) when clicking and dragging a title bar to move a window the mouse will  often minimize the window instead, very annoying, I had not even gotten close to the minus or plus symbols and was staying completely in the blank section of the title bar with the pointer 2) I was not able to click and drag a large rectangle over several icons at once to select them all at once- normally you can do this 3) I could not highlight part of a line of text without selecting the whole line, other mice can do this touch but not with this mouse on my older Mac Since, I've gone back to a wired mouse, no problems",pointer
I just bought another one for a work laptop and now a co-worker who has a different Microsoft wireless mouse can control my pointer from her cube (about 4-5 feet away),pointer
i try using it on my bed and sometimes its so hard to get the mouse pointer exactly where i want it,pointer
It's much harder to rapid fire with your pointer finger on the left button to fire in games,pointer
"But in a business setting, or anywhere that vaguely accurate pointer movement is desirable, this mouse is a disaster",pointer
- limited range: don t try using this as a pointer from across the room because it's not likely to respond,pointer
The laser is located near where the pinky finger would rest not under where the pointer finger is,pointer
")  The reason I purchased this mouse is that with the new laptop, even at the fastest mouse setting, I have to slide my finger back and forth over the touchpad several times to get the pointer from one side of the screen to the other",pointer
The cursor speed is significantly higher than any of the other pointer devices I have,pointer
This mouse compared to the Microsoft seems to move the pointer 2 or more pixels at a time,pointer
"that was the stipulations for me liking the mouse and even though i had to adjust the screen setting of the pointer (way too fast preset), i wouldn't even consider that a legitimate problem",pointer
"I have worked with all manner of keyboards, mice (1, 2, 3 buttons and combos), trackballs, pointers, pads and other input devices",pointer
"The one thing I am disappointed with is the software, mostly it's compatibility with Windows 7 my laptop's (lenovo T410) own trackpad and ""eraser"" pointer",pointer
"An easy fix is to change the mouse pointer scheme to ""None"" instead of ""Aero"" in the Mouse Properties section",pointer
"The mouse is stellar in almost all ways - great battery life, great precision movement, great control over response and customizable button",button
"I've had this mouse for about an hour now and I've come to these conclusions: - The scroll wheel is nice and smooth but will take some getting used to - Movement is generally precise but has been occasionally jerky and unresponsive - Mouse feels good in the hand though is a bit heavy (I realized I pick up the mouse to go across two monitors sometimes) - The button near the thumb (left and right arrows) seem pretty useless and really, really irritating to my thumb, if they weren't there this mouse would feel 100% better Maybe I still have to get used to it but I just might be shipping this thing back",button
"There are lots of button and some can be programmed for application-specific functions, although the number of compatible applications is small",button
"if there has a button on the mice to turn the power off, maybe better",button
"I was aware of some of the differences between the two: most notably, the auto-free-spin feature was removed and the Performance MX had a dedicated free-spin toggle button",button
"With my hands, if I place my thumb directly under the zoom/forward-back button, the palm area by the thumb is completely unsupported",button
"And finally, I've gotten so used to having the mouse wheel button function as the free-spin toggle that I often find myself clicking that when I'm trying to switch to free spin mode",button
On the other mice I used (and use concurrently; Anywhere MX) I assigned the middle mouse click to what is the free-spin toggle button on the Performance MX,button
"I reprogrammed those button for zoom (zoom in, zoom out, and ctrl+0, to be specific) and it was very fast and convenient when I had my 17"" laptop with a 1920x1200 resolution screen",button
"That said, the zoom button on the Performance MX, which you toggle by pressing the button and change by using the middle mouse wheel, will suffice and should please anyone who frequently needs to zoom but never had dedicated button for it before",button
The main feature of the revolution MX was implementation of the wheel button,button
"In order to get free spin, you have to press a button under the wheel, which is much less convenient",button
This is a good mouse I epically like how you can unlock the scroll while that will let you scroll through pages as fast as you want also the back button are good and easy to use when going back and forth in between web pages,button
"The scroll-wheel is great, the button are great, but this mouse fails at its fundamental task",button
"Logitech people, I hope you rectify and reinvent a new generation of Mice that combines improvements such: The ""Darkfield"", the location of the button to switch between windows and the small ""Unifying"" receiver of the ""Perfomance"" model, with the battery life, ergonomics and original system of rolling of the ""Revolution""",button
I'm especially fond of the hidden thumb button that I've grew accustomed to on my previous mouse (MX1100),button
"The middle click button works, but only if you press it at a certain angle with just the right amount of force",button
"They moved the placement of the back/forward button slightly higher on a ridge, above third programmable zoom button",button
My MX1100 had perfect placement of the back/forward button just slightly above the thumb,button
"With the new placement, I'm forced to life my thumb up and out above the ridge to press them, often times hitting the zoom button placed in between by mistake",button
"Fortunately, this mouse is fully supported by third-party software USB Overdrive which can configure all the button on the Performance MX",button
"I'll miss some of the special features the MX Revolution offers, such as the fast scrolling, the back and forward thumb button, etc, but having to replace my mouse every few months is absurd",button
(a few times I've hit the small side [back] button and missed a page so don't squeeze the mouse too hard),button
) The two thumb button are a little awkwardly placed,button
"Because of the more sudden curve into the mouse for the thumb area, those two button are placed a little high for easy access now",button
Another positive is that Logitech has added two button for the thumb (I would have at leased one more just to ensure that it will be a happy day),button
"However, I have to agree with several of my fellow commenters here in saying the mechanical DPI button? [have, agree, saying] [several, fellow, mechanical]
",button
"Besides, if I'm going to shell out this much doe for a fully programmable mouse, I want more button! ['m, going, shell, want] [much, programmable, more]
",button
The only problem I had with the customization is that sometimes it wouldn't keep the correct bindings you assigned to the button,button
It's very frustrating to be in the middle of the game and all of the sudden your reload button keeps kicking you out of the game and opening up a search tab in windows,button
"This is awesome mice, probably the 2nd most comfortable mice (1st was Microsoft) ever I used, battery is rechargeable, customizable button, unifying nano receiver was great",button
"The SetPoint software also touts the ability to allow you to assign application-specific key-presses or functions to the various mouse button, but I found that it couldn't do something as simple as register a press on the mouse-wheel as a middle-click (despite the software allowing me to set it up this way)",button
"Additionally, if you want to set up specific commands for this mouse such as ""one button search"" with Google, you'll find it doesn't work",button
Beneath the scrollwheel there is a small button that I think most people have mistaken for being a scroll speed enhancement,button
"Unfortunately, it's just a simple button that you can push to perform a search function",button
"However, as I have stated previously, attempting to set the button up for GOOGLE search or the like will not work on Mac",button
"I bought this mouse in particular because it had 5 button instead of 4, but the extra button on the left and right side are so difficult to hit they are basically useless",button
there is one little drawback: the rubber on both sides where you rest your three fingers (provided your index and middle fingers are on the button)changes color to be kind of green-yellowish,button
"Note also that Logitech's reset procedure involves six button actions and a switch flip, since there is no reset button on this mouse to reconnect the wireless, a seemingly clear design defect",button
"The kind of fake scroll button on the side, by fake I mean that it doesn't actually scroll, it moves back, forward, and clicks, doesn't have many uses, so far with the updates in place it can be used for a couple of things like change documents, change the volume and some others",button
The search button can be changed to where it's just like the middle click so no complaints there,button
"I couldn't find any great Logitech or Microsoft mouse that was: ergonomic, had a scroll wheel, and had extra programmable button",button
"On the nano mouse they are in the front and I loved those 2 button for browsing, this is not the case with this mouse, you have to move your hand or twist your thumb to much to reach them",button
The tab button down is a nice feature but the way the logitech software displays the open softwares is not usable so again this feature cannot be used unless you change the button behavior,button
"The nano mouse has a button on the top right down the wheel which I used to search things, it works very nice",button
"This one has one as well but its only to change the scroll mouse, and the search button or third button is moved pressing the scroll wheel which is terrible because you have to press so hard that your pointer moves away from the word selected and then it doesn't search",button
"Since the wheel is exactly for that, scrolling its impossible to press it down without scrolling at least a little the page and that is all it requires to cancel the function of the button",button
This was not the case if the third button was an extra button like in the nano,button
"This is not a good gaming mouse because its too heavy especially in competitive online games where you compete with the mice, also the application switcher button and the zoom button cannot be programed for any game so its a letdown",button
The sleek design and multiple button makes it sleek as well as professional,button
The button have great travel and an improved softer click,button
"Has the two back/forward side button, something the older G5's lack, and even current G7's",button
The button are useful and well placed,button
The number of programmable button is unparalleled,button
#NAME?,button
The scroll wheel is designed to serve as the middle button,button
I ended up working around the issue by remapping the zoom button to be the middle button,button
"It had 10 programable button functionality (tilt left/right), three button including center wheel push, four thumb button, and a button to switch between free spin wheel and detent wheel (awesome)",button
The only problem I have with this mouse is the lack of explorer button (back and forward) that are in the thumb location of the larger desktop mouse models,button
As a developer I use the middle mouse button alot and this is useless,button
"Thus, I continually press the zoom button when attempting to press the back button",button
Pros: looks insanely awesome feels fairly comfortable has a good amount of programmable button cons: absolutely not portable not really great for gaming - the design doesn't allow for me to click as quick as I need to in my favorite game (league of legends) no internal memory - so if you program a key - you'll need to reload the software if you move the mouse to a different comp,button
"The product came to me scratched up and the button to release the top to put the batteries in is partly jammed so its hard to get it to open, and the mouse stops working from time to time and gets disconnected from my computer frequently",button
"I would like to have a couple additional button by the thumb for going back and forward in browsers, but I knew that going in on the purchase so I cannot complain too much",button
Positioning the mouse for optimum use of the top button and scroll wheel moves your thumb away from the application switching wheel,button
"The application switching wheel is located too far way from the ""front"" and ""back"" button, and moving your thumb from the button to the wheel forces the mouse to move because of where the back of the mouse sits relative to the base of your thumb",button
"Is so convenient that I am actually using the old receiver rather than the one that came with Wireless Notebook Optical 3000, I just synchronized them pushing both connect button, because the usb receiver loss some signal when plugged on the back of my PC which is near the floor, and when I want to use it with my laptop, I sync back with the usb receiver",button
"Only other thing that would make it better is more button to act more functionality, but hey, it's a mini mouse",button
I wish the mouse had more button and maybe the option to switch the rechargeable batteries,button
"If not an OFF switch, then they need to program it to shut off after X minutes of non-use with a restart button on it",button
If you don't use a lot of button on your mouse this is a non-issue,button
I reprogrammed one of the button to perform a keystroke to open a new tab in IE (which is the only thing I used the wheel-click for previously),button
There is a tiny button in the recess where the transmitter is placed to turn off the power,button
"It would have been much more convenient to have just a small On/Off button instead, so the transmitter could be left plugged in",button
Previous review that you couldn't program the button is in error,button
", have the middle/wheel button show/hide all tools in Photoshop",button
This Performance MX has one less button than the MX1100,button
"For MX1100, I used one pair of button of volume up/down, another pair for shift/control, and the hidden thumb button for application switcher",button
"Before I bought Performance MX, since its zoom button has to be combined with scroll wheel in order to zoom up/down, I thought the zoom button could also be programmed to work with scroll wheel to control volume as well",button
So it leaves me one button short,button
"In addition to the usual left/right clickers and the scroll wheel, there are also two additional button controls on the sides, and these can be used for additional tasks like moving forward and backward through web page",button
"It has it's bugs (in Vista x64 it would sometimes forget your settings on startup and you would need to double click the SetPoint taskbar icon for it to activate - an example is the wheel setting, being click-to-click or middle button)",button
"Which, in turn, comes with many features of which: - Configurable wheel (free to spin - or normal click-click-click), if you don't want a middle-button you can set it to shift between the two",button
#NAME?,button
"- 2 additional button on the side, and one in the middle just behind the wheel - configurable to whatever you like",button
"This makes a lot of accidental scrolling and disjointed scrolling, if I happen to scroll down quick with the precision button on (makes the wheel click for more precise scrolling) the scroll will eventually scroll up in a middle of scrolling down, or vice versa",button
"3> It would make sense to configure the button just behind the wheel to act as middle click button, no? [make, configure, act] [middle]
",button
I programmed the the two arrow button on the left edge of the mouse as middle click,button
"The Thumb Wheel button, One-Touch Search, Thumb Back, and Thumb Forward can be assigned okay, and have a fairly good choice of functions they can perform, including different clicks or a keystroke",button
"I wound up setting most apps for manual shift, which is accomplished with the center (scroll wheel) button",button
"It DOES make available left-tilt, right-tilt, forward-thumb-wheel, and backward-thumb-wheel, as 4 separate button which can be assigned to anything in that software's long list of functions",button
"The reasons for my giving this mouse 2 stars instead of 1 are it's incredible comfort in my hand, the nice feel of the scroll wheel, the number and good placement of button (almost as good as the MX-1000), and usefulness of the scroll wheel's ""Free-Spinning"" mode",button
"I probably would have kept it and used USB Overdrive, doing without the one button, IF the scroll wheel mode-shifting hadn't broken down after such a short time",button
"ATTENTION LOGITECH: A mouse with this ergonomic design, this scroll wheel with a rugged purely mechanical mode switch button, the thumb wheel, AND the button arrangement of the MX-1000 would be the ultimate mouse! [be] [ergonomic, rugged, mechanical, ultimate]
",button
"It would be nice if the button to turn it off didn't require sticking the USB receiver in it, because I never unplug that from the computer",button
The smallest bump means you need to reset the connection by pressing a tiny button under the mouse with the corner of your fingernail,button
The middle mouse button (wheel) is already failing to register clicks after only two days of use,button
"However, if you are looking for an ambidextrous mouse with back/forward button and a micro receiver there are few other alternatives",button
It works well under linux but you have to map the extra button yourself which can be a pain for people not really familiar with LINUX,button
A major pro of the mouse is button placement,button
All of its button are well placed and easily reachable,button
"Newer Logitech mice that have a two-mode wheel, like my recently purchased G500, use a physical button instead",button
There are back and forward button next to your thumb that allow you to navigate websites a bit faster but I rarely use those button,button
The button are well placed and responsive,button
"I'm especially fond of the way the thumb roller lets me go to the desktop and run through open pages via Vista, and the one touch button on the top taking me to my favorite search engine is good too",button
"I never figured-out how to hack Microsoft mice for the functions I needed on mouse button (escape), so I was looking-forward to programming the MX-R button for AutoCAD (which was easy, but created a huge per-application configuration MESS in their UI)",button
And the back button is nicely placed,button
"Clicking the wheel button down takes more effort than it should -- which is why this is not a great mouse for users of Maya and other 3D programs (you use the middle button A LOT in Maya! [Clicking, takes, is, is, use] [great, other, 3D, middle]
",button
We  need an on/off button to use when one does not use the optical wireless mouse,button
"Even the ""clicker"" button, makes the scroll wheel ""feel"" like previous mice did, was bad",button
"So, if you push straight down on the button, the mouse thinks you are either doing nothing, or trying to push the scroll wheel to the right to scroll right instead of middle click",button
There's a little button behind the scroll wheel that is intended to enable you change the scroll speed from slow to fast,button
"And why for crying out loud do we need a separate button to control scrolling speed in the first place? [crying, do, need, control] [separate, scrolling, first]
",button
"There is a dedicated button to switch between free and ""clicky"" scroll wheel",button
"Theres more to it than ""comfy to hold"" I'll also add that it has LESS button than my previous logitech mouse",button
I was using an old bluetooth logitech mouse on my Mac and desperately wanted a new mouse w/ extra button,button
My old one didn't have horizontal wheel scroll or back/forward button so hence I went mouse shopping,button
I realized I couldn't use the extra two button on the side without installing the Microsoft Intellipoint software,button
"I was able to program the button to do what I wanted them to do, but I was disappointed I couldn't program the mouse wheel's ""horizontal scroll"" to act as button since the newer Logitech software can do that",button
Logitech also changed the location of the zoom button to underneath the back and forward button instead of in the center of them where it was hard to reach,button
"It fits nicely into your hand (as far as I know, there is no left handed option available), and button are right there where they need to be",button
"Som people may find all the extra button useful, I use them occasionally but most of the time I forget they're there",button
It would be nice if the mouse had a small shutoff button,button
"The button feel is comfortable - you don't have to press too hard, which I've found to be a problem on some other mice",button
"Also, I do wish that there was a programmable button that I could use for double-clicking",button
"Ergonomically the MS mouse is fine, and I like the discreet left & right button, much better that the Mighty Mouse",button
It works reliably and has as many configurable button as I would ever want,button
"I don't care if you use the forward/back button as designed or with other keystroke assignments, the zoom button being underneath is utterly pointless",button
"grinding inside that made the mouse emit a terribly annoying chirping noise anytime the button (THE button, on a mouse at least) was clicked",button
Never having used a no click scrolling button before I really had no idea I'd find it so difficult to use while scrolling through pictures,button
#NAME?,button
"The left button makes the same tinny click when you press down, but when you let go it makes a louder sound, almost like a knock on a door",button
It has a slew of button which can easily be programmed or reprogrammed and the rubberized left and right side of the mouse keep your hands from slipping off,button
"It's large, fits in my hand well enough and comes with an on/off button, useful if I decide to take it with me when I travel",button
This mouse is ok on the button/click feel side of things but the wheel is ultra sensitive and has no clicking detentes in it,button
"the button on the right and left side allow for easy movement between song, pages",button
On a Mac (Snow Leopard) the left and right button and the scroll wheel work right out of the box,button
"But the configuration utility does not let you access all the button as far as I can tell, so to get full functionality you will need the Logitech bloatware (Logitech generally writes very inefficient and bulky driver software)",button
"The earlier MXs have slightly better ergonomics, more logical button placement and in the case of the 1100 more intuitive DPI controls",button
They removed SmartShift from the scroll wheel and took the top button and replaced it with some mechanical shift mechanism,button
"It glides smoothly on the desk, the scroll wheel rotates smoothly, even the button feel smooth when you click them",button
The back & forward button are fine,button
"When gaming, if I click too hard on the left button, I get kicked out of sites, menu's come up and other weird happenings occur",button
"For the price, I don't think a mouse should be reformatting your settings merely by applying too much pressure or by touching another button by mistake",button
"The previous Revolution mouse had a smart-switch, which has been replaced by a button to toggle between regular scrolling and low-friction hyperscrolling",button
"The build quality of this mouse is great, EXCEPT for that toggle button",button
The microswitch went bad on the left button and it's not serviceable,button
I got this as a warranty replacement for my previous MX Revolution (double-click/false-click problem with the left button  which itself was purchased to replace my old MX 1000),button
"Pros: Accurate, works on most surfaces, comfortable, tiny receiver Cons: Horrible backward/forward button design, can't redefine mouse wheel left and right click The design of this mouse has highs and lows",button
"The main left and right button are very well designed, and go all the way to the front of the mouse (if you've had a mouse that doesn't, you'll know this makes it difficult to click when your fingers hang over the edge of the mouse a bit)",button
"The only critical design flaw, one which Microsoft has built into other mice as well, are the forward and back button",button
They put one button on identical locations on both sides of the mouse,button
"However, both types of people will find that when just moving the mouse around, you are always hitting the button on the off side where your ring and pinky fingers hang over the edge",button
"The ONLY button that can be set as Middle is the scroll wheel, which doesn't click as well as other wheels",button
"It can be depressed as a button, but isn't customizable",button
"Back and forward don't work like normal, some programs behave differently (or not at all) with the button used for it",button
"The search button can't be assigned to all the functions available to back, forward, and wheel tilt",button
"Small complaints:  I can configure my other Logitech mouse to execute a ""Show Desktop"" command on a non-essential button press",button
This is a great mouse except for the fact that there is no middle mouse button,button
"Worse for my usage needs (gaming and graphic design programs), when clicking the middle button it's very easy to accidentally trigger the mouse wheel",button
It sounds like some people have no problem with the middle wheel/button,button
If the middle button & wheel weren't so important for my uses I'd be very happy,button
"""The problem is on the mini-PCB which is used to detect the left, right, and middle mouse button, as well as handle the scroll wheel",button
The MX Revolution's mouse had a middle mouse button,button
This one replaces it with a button that switches your scroll wheel to hyper scroll,button
"It does seem to have problems tracking on some surfaces, but the one thing that creates the biggest annoyance is when I run it in parallels on auto-CAD the scroll wheel is way too sensitive and I can't seem to change the settings once in windows (running parallels on macbook) The good thing is that all of the button help to navigate quickly",button
"This mouse has a total of 10 usable button (logitech claims 7), however, the flaw in logitechs set point 4",button
0 software is that not all of the button are customizable,button
This is a third party software add on that allows much more customization of the button,button
There is a 'flip document' button/wheel on the side of the mouse,button
The uber option firmware allows you to set 3 commands on it (forward/back/and click) Another lack of customization comes to setting the button to open certain files,button
"My one complaint against it would be the mouse wheel, which takes a bit more pressure than one would like to click down to perform third-mouse button functionality",button
All left button go to double-click finally,button
I can zoom one-handed w/o the Ctrl button,button
"It seemed a bit heavy at first but I got over that quickly and I'm unable to find the feature for the ""ridge"" feeling for the scroll button",button
"The scroll wheel, the assortment of programmable button, the precision, and the overall feel are satisfactory",button
"However even if i move the mouse out of range for a second, and bring it back into range, i need to hit the reset button on the mouse and wireless adapter to get the mouse working again",button
"Side button: probably in the best place they can put them for a tiny mouse, but accidentlly clicked sometimes",button
"Used to have to hack together some stuff to get that to work with my old Logitech mouse (USB Overdrive software, bind control-left arrow to side button)",button
"Ergonomics, accuracy is tops Left button broken after 10 months (one click acts like double click in 9 out of 10 cases)",button
this mouse is vary nice i like the grips on the side and the back and fowrd button on the side,button
you can kiss the top 'Search' button off,button
USB Overdrive will even allow you to map the tilt-scroll wheel as button so you will have more 'button' on the top,button
Even SteerMouse's remapped button-commands do not stick and when a button is pushed it may or may not even be highlighted in SteerMouse's preference pane window,button
"Weight much less than the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 4000, and have 5 button, while that one have four",button
"It has both a forward & back button, a smooth scroll wheel and texturized sides for grip",button
"Pressing the thumbrest area activates a button that can be used with Expose, which is nice for window management",button
"Having a real right mouse button is a real treat! [Having, is] [real, right, real]
",button
"Scroll wheel and button work fine, side-scrolling with wheel is a little awkward because you expect some sort of resistance feedback or click and there is none",button
"By default it uses a 1000 dpi setting I believe but you have to assign the DPI setting to a button (I use the wheel press) to set a secondary option (for me I have done OK with 700 dpi, not quite as sensitive to every slight movement)",button
"The placement of the button on the side, which I use for forward/back on the internet, are placed too high and too far foward to be comfortable",button
"Actually, this was good, because it showed me just how customizable most of the button and settings are",button
"Just above it is a small button which, when pressed with a word or phrase highlighted, will initiate a seach based on that term",button
"There are also two button just above the thumb groove which I've used mainly to flip back and forward between web pages, but haven't set to do much else yet",button
"One, i can't get the cool ""thumb"" button to work in any games I have and two: this sucker sucks down the battery life",button
There is a small button behind the scroll wheel which is uncomfortable when using the scroll wheel,button
"Then, you can highlight an area of text and simply click the top search button to look it up in your search engine",button
It's got forward and backwards button right on it that make web surfing effortless,button
it works very good and it's super responsive I really like this mouse but how everyone else said it falls a bit short due to not having a off button but other then that it seems like a sturdy mouse I hope it lasts me for a good while,button
Many different button on the mouse and my favorite is the thumb button that instantly displays little windows of all your open applications,button
"I wish I could remember to use all the other zoom, forward/backward and other button on the mouse",button
"It is small, has five button, and is customizable",button
"It rattles everywhere: the battery cover, the left and right mouse clickers, and the scroll wheel push button",button
"Other than that, left button failure after 6 months (now requiring multiple clicks for applications, to open files, etc vs",button
"I have to say when I first got it I was very annoyed with it, there is this little button that sticks out right below the scroll wheel to toggle between smooth scrolling and contextual scrolling",button
"Additionally I thought I would like the shape of the mouse but apparently what I didn't realize is that I don't actually grasp my mouse, I kind of grab it with my fingers and move it around that way to prevent a complete arm move so my fingers don't really reach all the button on the mouse",button
Tons of button make it perfect for gaming,button
Nice 2 button (3 if you click the wheel) mouse,button
"In theory I have them set the left side button set to ""paste"" and the right side button set to ""undo""",button
"You can't assign button/click combos, only specific clicks or combinations of button",button
"My VX Revolution has 8 programable button, tilt wheel, cordless laser, and fast scrolling",button
"I have followed the instructions for the first test, ""swapping the functions of the left mouse button and the right mouse button""",button
I understand that the left mouse button of your Logitech VX Revolution is not working properly,button
"In regards to your issue, please try the following steps: You can isolate the issue by swapping the functions of the left mouse button and the right mouse button",button
"To swap the functions of the right and left mouse button, under Button configuration, select the Switch primary and secondary button check box",button
I think the forward/backward button are a little too high,button
"On the VX there was just a spring loaded slide on the top left that you could push forward or backward to zoom in and out, now it is one button above the thumb that you hold and move the mouse scroll wheel to zoom",button
It gives you more control but one less button to map which I miss,button
The new button I like is the one under your thumb,button
"They got rid of the ""one touch"" search button on top of the mouse",button
They replaced this with the toggle button to have the mouse wheel click or free spin,button
(another mappable button gone),button
On the older version of setpoint you could map any button you want,button
With this mouse there are some button it simple will not let you map to application specific settings,button
That really annoyed me but I found you can edit the xml file yourself to allow application specific functions for any button,button
"The main downsides are less mappable button compared to my old VX Revolution, and the setpoint software should give the user more control",button
"Minor complaint - during vigorous mouse usage (gaming) it is possible to accidentally hit the ""zoom"" or ""application switcher"" button",button
"I switched the zoom button to be a DPI changer for ease of switching between sniping/regular gameplay, sometimes when you're whipping around you can put it on low DPI which makes you turn slower, can be disorienting",button
"On the revolution, this was a CONFIGURABLE button (defaulted to open up windows search I think, I used it as middle click since I run Red Hat for work)",button
"On THIS mouse, however, the button simply switches the ""mode"" of the scroll wheel from free-spin mode (very low friction, spins forever) to a more clicky mode, where the wheel stops quickly but only moves in discrete increments",button
"I only used free spin to get to the end of large documents before, but now the extra button click means its usually just faster to go click the side bar to scroll down",button
I have to disable it to play anything that uses the scroll wheel as a secondary weapon swap button,button
Rest all features are standard for high end mice like this which has multiple configurable button,button
"But I am annoyed at Microsoft's complacence and bad design - their ""ergonomic"" mouse's scroll wheel was so hard to press, it was hard to use as a middle button and caused more strain than a normal mouse",button
Good selection of button and knobs that are well laid out,button
"It had lots of features but it was a pain to configure, didn't have the options I wanted and came unconfigured at some point, so I only really use 5 of the button",button
* Back and forward button are double clicking for some reason,button
The extra button are cool and helpful after getting used to using them (though my wife gets annoyed by them as she hits them accidentally),button
My favorite is the little search button that lets you highlight text to be searched and then access your favorite search engine automatically,button
"I also like the thumb button which allow you to switch back and forth amongst windows and applications, although I have found these to be a bit less intuitive, thereby taking a little longer to get the hang of",button
The basic ability for a critical button to even function correctly is not a factor that should come into play at this level,button
"this is because the wheel itself does not scroll, instead there is like a rubber piece that rotates around an unmoving round middle button",button
"It beats other PC mice hands-down, and Apple mice aren't worth it because they refuse to offer more than one button",button
The functionality of the three button is smooth and easy,button
"My last mouse, cordless laser also but fairly cheap, has fantastic software that lets you assign just about anything you want to not only the button/wheels, but also to combinations of button",button
"The Setpoint gives some very basic choices for reassignment, but for some totally unknown reason won't let you define a third (center) mouse button, which I use constantly",button
"Personally, I am not much of a scroller so the absence of clicks bothers me not at all, and I also don't use the far right and left side button either, which is a good thing because I think those are inconveniently placed",button
The only reason it didn't get a 5 is because the full-size brother that I use on my desktop has two button on the side that cause my browser to go forward or backwards - I VERY nice feature when surfing,button
the bad 1) i could use more button if there where available,button
"The ergonomic design leaves allot to be desired, indeed it is a laptop mouse and as such you can expect for some concessions when it goes to ergonomics, but it having an analog mouse wheel is simply annoying, and don't get me started on those puny extra button on the sides of the mouse that will not let you click them without lifting your hand of the mouse",button
The new fancy scrollwheel cannot be used as a regular button - wheel click is hardwired to change the scroll mode,button
"If, like many people, you're a user of software which makes use of the middle button (like Firefox) then forget it",button
"In short, this mouse works with no perceptible lag, is constructed well and has enough button/features to satisfy the average user looking for something beyond a basic wireless mouse",button
"This could have been negated had Logitech elected to use a cable like that found on their G700 mouse wherein the micro USB connector is encased in a larger than normal chunk of plastic that is keyed to fit into a guide on the front of the mouse Pros/cons relative to the MX Revolution: + Subjectively, I prefer the matte silver accents on the Performance MX to the piano black of the MX Revolution + No charging contacts to wear out + Doesn't require dedicated/specific charging base + Receiver is much smaller, approximately 20% as long (~7mm vs ~38mm) as that for the MX Revolution - The MX Revolution could be configured to switch from regular to freewheel scrolling based on the speed the user is scrolling at, the Performance MX can only be switched via a physical button located below/behind the scroll wheel - this is also less functional in that the button used to switch scroll modes on the Performance MX cannot be used/remapped for any other purpose as can the button that occupies the same place on the MX Revolution",button
In place of the thumb wheel/button there is a button located in the portion of the mouse where the user's thumb rests on the left side of the Performance MX,button
"While this button is useful in its own right, the thumb wheel/button is one of the MX Revolution's best features",button
There is also a Zoom button located directly below the back/forward button on the side of the Performance MX but it isn't very prominent and is too close to the back/forward button in my opinion,button
#NAME?,button
"For me at least, this requires more movement to reach the forward button with my thumb on the Performance MX",button
"The mouse doesn't change to fast-scroll mode on the fly, but is instead activated by a mechanical button press",button
"Couple this with moving the thumb back button further out on the device, and you get a mouse that is solid, and has great tracking, but very, very poor usability",button
"To me, the forward and back button on either side were right under my fingers  but not comfortable to use",button
"I did not like the scroll control button and the limited assignments options for programing the button, but I figured I would get use to it so I resolved to adjust to the new mouse and enjoy the best of it",button
"I owned two Revolution MX in the past, left button on both did not last long but they did last at least a year",button
"For example, when I press and hold down left button on the top of window, it induce double click and maximize the window for me",button
"The middle-click button will work if you give it a conscious effort every time you use it, but it requires you to press extra hard",button
I am not much for thumb wheels and button,button
"But, since I could program that button to be non-operative during specific programs, I'm not too bothered about that",button
The only minor complaint that I have is that rolling the scroll button up makes a clicking sound,button
"Also, the back and forward button do not sit under where my fingers naturally fall, so I would have to readjust a little any time I wanted to use them",button
"The 510 has a shape similar to my old Intellimouse, with a nice curved area for my thumb, and the back forward button are right where they should be, both on the left side, right under where my thumb rests",button
Reset only lasts a short time (push the button on the bottom of the receiver and then the button on the bottom of the mouse),button
Left and right button clicks siliently 4,button
"Unfortunately in the Performance MX they've chosen to use a mechanical button to switch modes, and after pressing it once it just has that cheapo feeling like it's going to be breaking soon",button
I purchased this item in September 06 and the right button has just given out (Feb,button
"7 button 4 thumb button witth the standard 3 on top Cons: when using the middle button to click on links to open in a new window, the mouse wants to scroll the window up or down causing you to miss your click",button
"Pros: -High build quality -Lots of button -Spin wheel -precision sensor -fits hand well -usb/ac cable charge option = versatility -uses nimh batteries easily replaced -small usb reciever Cons: -thumb button are too high up on the mouse and require a reach -no dock -tilt button have no tactile feedback -no holder for usb reciever on mouse -cable bag doesn't have enough space for mouse as well -no auto profile switching as with g9 -zoom button right below forward and back thumb button, forward back are more important than zoom, but zoom gets in the way, you are likely to press it by accident, poor design choice",button
"So for office work this is a good mouse, for fast paced action games where you need more easy to reach button, not so much",button
"The main issue with this mouse for gaming are the thumb button which require you to loosen your grip and reach to hit them, and that is bad during a game and not even all that convenient during desktop use",button
"Thumb button should require nothing more than a smidgen of a movement to hit, and the only ones you can do that with are the zoom button which is above your thumb on an overhanging ledge, meaning when you squeeze it, you lift the mouse a bit, not what you want in any gaming situation",button
"Logitech replaced the automatic free-style spin with a cheap cheesy plastic ""locking"" button that you have to push in order to free-spin or scroll normally",button
I think a flatter button would be more comfortable,button
I am disappointed overall with the mouse because i was hoping the task flip wheel / button whatever would speed up my production,button
I can program the button to do different things such as using the scroll wheel tilt feature to toggle my osnaps,button
"The problem is that it takes a great deal of effort to tilt the wheel, usually ending up in hitting the left or right mouse button and bringing up an unwanted command",button
The zoom button is located to close to the back or forward button so it is to easy to think you are selecting one button only to be selecting another,button
"I've replaced the batteries with several kinds of brand new alkalines, I've pressed the ridiculously tiny little white button over and over again, and I've downloaded and installed and uninstalled and reinstalled until my head ached, and that was before the hangover it drove me to",button
Built very solid and reacts beautifully--accurate motion and button just feel good,button
"Short review : GREAT mouse, this should be the only mouse anyone should ever have to own, it's comfortable and I use the customizable side button for my volume",button
"First, the back/forward button are set rather higher up on the side of the mouse than I expected, which requires a short period of adjustment",button
"A simple turn off button could have been nicer, or maybe a sleep mode that turned itself off with non use? [have, been, turned] [simple, nicer, non]
",button
I resolved this by assigning the thumb button to do work as the middle click,button
"Set up is very easy, and it worked right away, unlike the previous mouse where I had to press the connect button at least 10 times for it to start working",button
"My complaints are mainly about the button; this mouse has a lot of them (seven plus the wheel) and they're not all convenient to press when you want, or to not press when you don't",button
"In particular, the ""zoom"" button is placed too close to the forward/back button, so it's easy to mistakenly press that one",button
"The thumb button on the base of the unit is my favorite though, since it's perfectly placed and stiff enough not to press accidentally but easy to press when needed",button
"The scroll wheel is nice, and there's a button to switch from ""ratcheted"" to ""smooth"" depending on your preference",button
"The software that controls this mouse is robust, allowing the button to be reprogrammed easily, though it is somewhat limited since it is not capable of doing some macro functions (using the Windows Start button, for instance)",button
"It also supports application specific programming, so the thumb button can do one thing when in Excel or do something completely different in Excel (or any other application)",button
"I like it over all, but there is a feature the slightly more expensive Microsoft mobile mouse(3500) has that this doesn't: the back button",button
#NAME?,button
"When using the back/forth button to move between pages, I have to hit the button several times to get the pages to go back and forth - kind of defeats the purpose of having button instead of using the back/forth button in IE",button
"7) several other button intended to be activated by your thumb are also terribly placed, they are always under your thumb",button
"The only problem I have with it is that when I press the center button and move the mouse in The Sims 3, the camera angle doesn't change like it does with my old mouse, which can be quite annoying",button
"So is the ability to push the scroll wheel button left and right to pan a web window left and right, if the window isn't open wide enough",button
"As an architect, i use the middle button more than 50% of the day to navigate around my CAD models",button
"The 'click' stutters, so you think you are holding down the middle button, , and you're pressing real hard, because you know this is an issue, but as you start to rotate your model, its releases just for a millisecond, enough to send your model somewhere out of view",button
"it's so close to the left button (you can even see this in the logitech picture) that you have to hold the mouse with your other hand, lift your right finger off and carefully push hoping your finger can get a hold",button
The first one squeaked when I pushed the right mouse button and clicked loudly like one of those cricket clickers kids had when I was young,button
"The wheel on the 2nd one worked intermittently when rolled and also when clicked as a button, and the wheel on the 3rd one only worked as a middle button if I tilted it a little to the right (not too much though) before pushing on it",button
"On the older MX 1100 mouse the forward and back button on the left side of the mouse are perfectly placed, exactly where my thumb goes when I reach for them",button
"On the new Performance MX mouse a zoom button has been added where my thumb naturally goes, and the forward and back button moved above the zoom button where they are quite inconvenient to find and use",button
"I don't know any mouse users that zoom more frequently than they use the forward and back button when web browsing, but that is apparently Logitech's design philosophy on this mouse",button
"Personally, I used Setpoint to change the zoom button on the new Performance MX to a back button which makes it much more useful",button
The size is nice for me and the button and the scroll wheel has a good feel,button
The back and foward button on the mouse's sides are tiny and not situated in a natural position,button
"As i tend to have a lot of programs running at any given time, the thumb button that pulls a view of all open programs to choose from is a Godsend",button
I like the scroll wheel with the separate button to allow quick scroll much better than the automatic approach used on the Revolution,button
"This mouse is great: wonderful battery life, good (quiet and easy) click/scroll and lots of button, but it has a huge problem",button
"Also, this mouse, using the micro unifying reciever does not have any sync button underneath it",button
"There is also a button on the thumb rest which is very easy to press as almost the entire surface down there, covered with perforated rubber, is clickable",button
"There's no lights on this mouse during normal usages, possibly to save battery life, but if you set one of the button to switch dpi (mouse sensitivity), the 3 lights blink briefly, with either the top 2 or bottom 2 lighting to indicate which mode you're in, then turns off",button
"The left and right mouse button deliver a crisp click, and all other button are just fine, my only mention is off the left and right 'scroll' button which are simply to lean the mouse wheel to either side",button
"Software: I would have liked to be able to set the DPI for the mouse in the main menu than having to assign a button to change the DPI, because I like to have it set to the maximum",button
"So: all button assignable, great scroll wheel (although sometimes the fast scroll is",button
"Still wish the middle button (scroll wheel) had better haptics, but this mouse is otherwise a great bet, along with any other ""darkfield"" models",button
What I like: + the button are very very configurable,button
+ all the button and wheel are easy to access (large hands) What I don't like - the free wheel option becomes sticky (I mean it does not roll so freely) after a few months,button
"Breaking it in and getting used to using the features and button is a learning curve on any mouse or peripheral, this one seems to be a very easy one",button
"The 4000 feels a lot more sturdy, but it's too hard to use the scroll wheel button so I never use the 4000",button
"I have to press the ""connect"" button on both the mouse and the USB receiver, which isn't an easy feat",button
I happen to have a disability (spinal cord injury) where my hands don't work as well as I'd like but with this mouse and all of the ways you can customize its button makes it a breeze for me to use,button
Both of these mice have Both Forward and Backward button which are essential for Internet surfing,button
"I have to give the point to Logitech, however, for better placement of the button",button
The left button is just above where most people would place their thumb which makes it less easy to press,button
"It took a day or two to get used to the feel and the high placement of the side button, but I'm fine with it",button
"And the app switcher on the bottom thumb button is gold! [is] [bottom, gold]
",button
"The battery cover and release button seem a bit weak, but I never had a problem with it though so I'd say it's negligible",button
"Would love a 4th back button! [love] [4th, back]
",button
"I previously owned a MX620 and that had the button positioned great, they were very easy to use",button
"The button are fine, but the palm rest is either not big enough or tapers off too quickly",button
"Secondly, in Firefox, the ""back button"" injects special character into dialog boxes if there is no page to go back to",button
"Fifth, if you're like me, and have a desk with a keyboard tray that is not big enough for a full sized keyboard (with numpad) and a mouse side-by-side, and have to place the mouse in front of the keyboard, you'll hate the wrap-around mouse button",button
It would be nice if the button were protected by a front bezel,button
"I'd put up with the rest, because this mouse is feature rich with assignable button, and very good accuracy",button
They added 2 button to the thumb area and the lower one is poorly place,button
"First off the software that come with this mouse enhance the convenience of this mouse by letting you set the function of the button to do different jobs base on the program you current have open, for example, a single button my have different function in microsoft word than it does in media player",button
Other button are customizable,button
It tracks well and button are nice,button
"I saw that one reviewer said there is no available software to program the button and that is true if you are looking for extra features, but Windows and Mac have the capacity to swith the button for left-hand users",button
"In addition, there is a small button for zoom below forward/back that I keep hitting",button
"The scroll wheel has a button to either set in precision or free wheel mode, mine came from factory in free wheel",button
- the well-placed ambidextrous side button (even my lefty-specific mouse has more awkward button),button
"The addition button, quick scroll, zoom are excellent features",button
The MX1000's side scroll button are very positive feeling and the scroll wheel protruded more from the top of the mouse so using the side scroll function just worked,button
"The dark laser performance is awesome, the button feel is very good, the contour of the mouse feels good in my hand",button
"Really useful button, with nothing in a place that I'm likely to press by accident",button
It's nice to have separate right and left button since the Apple Mighty Mouse always feels like you're not quite sure which side of the mouse you are really clicking with,button
Having a lot of button would be great if they worked,button
"My only complaint is that it does not have any programmable button that you can use for functions like ""back"" in your browser - if it had that it would be perfect for my purposes",button
"-Chrome accents -A pretty blue light -An independent ON/OFF button that ""clicks"" rather than can accidentally be pushed",button
"Logitech made the on/off button push - which is annoying when travelling, because you accidentally hit it on all the time, thus wasting batter life",button
MS placed the front/back button in sort of an awkward spot for people with big hands,button
Logitech got around this issue by making the front/back button next to the left click,button
"People argue that they accidentally tap the back button instead of left click, but this has never been an issue for me and I have big hands",button
I find it easier to use the front/back button on the logitech,button
"When navigating in 3D, you need the middle mouse button a lot",button
I found myself trying to press the scroll wheel and accidentally pressing the left button in addition or instead of middle button because of the extremely awkward angle,button
"I could of course remap one of the other 4 button to be a middle click, but it still is very disappointing that such an expensive top of the line mouse would have such a major design flaw",button
"It is a very nice mouse that performs well, very responsive and the 5 button feature is nice",button
The only thing I don't like about it is the page-scrolling button,button
"I especially like to use one of the left button for paste, & none are quite in the right place for my hand, + I have a tendency to hit 2 of the button on the left accidentally",button
It's uncomfortable & I often push the lower left button by accident,button
"Really useful button, with nothing in a place that I'm likely to press by accident",button
"Slightly larger than other Logitech mice I've used in past, getting comfortable with hand position has taken a while but the accuracy and function of button and wheel is superb",button
The button are well-placed and the scroll wheel action is smooth,button
"Finally, it would be nice to be able to touch some button on the mouse and see the battery level indicators light up on demand because they only display the battery level status when switching the mouse on Overall, a very nice quality desktop mouse that works on any surface",button
"Also, the scroll wheel had a feature that wasn't obvious to me at first when I looked at the product online: there is a small button next to the scroll wheel which switches between normal scrolling found in other mice (where you hear a grinding noise as you scroll) and a smooth super-fast scrolling (with this, if you spin the scroll wheel fast, it just keeps scrolling freely on its own for a good couple of seconds before it stops! [had, was, looked, is, switches, found, hear, grinding, scroll, spin, keeps, scrolling, stops] [obvious, small, normal, other, smooth, super-fast, own, good]
",button
"You can either have a button that switches, or you can actually configure a threshold where, if you spin the wheel hard enough, the mouse will actually switch all on it's own",button
I use this because it really feels much nicer than having to hit the button all the time,button
It can only be toggled between click-click mode and free mode using the button just below the scroll wheel,button
"So you have to resort to predicting that you are going to want the free-spin mode, hit the button, flick the wheel, then hit the button again to go back to click-click",button
The stealth button is pretty cool,button
"After two years intensive service, my MX Performance has begun to develop issues with the left button clicking multiple times on a single click",button
"This review is not concerned with button (or whistles), but rather the ease of use, feel in the hand while working, and the degree of sensitivity of the vertical scroll wheel",button
I prefer the older left and right click button of the older Revolution twins,button
"My biggest gripes are related to the button placement and SetPoint software, however",button
The current thumb-button placement (for page forward and back functions) feels too high and sticks too far out--the zoom button is in a more usable location and could theoretically be set to another function,button
"Overall pretty happy, but with two peeves: 1) The mouse is designed for your hand to sit far up on the mouse, but the side button are way back",button
Had they simply put the side button further up (there appears to be plenty of real estate) this problem would have been avoided,button
"I didn't like the feel of the middle mouse button, always seemed loose(Maybe cause it never worked right)",button
"I find all the button and track wheel placement just fine, unlike some of the other commenters",button
"The ""back"" button on the left (I'm right handed) is right under my thumb",button
"I find that it's not quite as comfortable in my claw-style mouse grip, and more annoyingly, the back button is no longer where my thumb sits, so I frequently press the application-selector button instead",button
") Cons: Doesn't automatically shut off Sometimes has a hard time connecting to the receiver, and doesn't have a reset or connect button like many other wireless mice do",button
"The construction is great, ergonomics are fantastic, button placement is also great",button
I have other Logitech mouse and the placement of those button were perfect,button
The positions of the side button and side wheel are just about perfect,button
I constantly have to stop and correct myself or I start hitting other button,button
(the mouse will work fine without downloading anything as long as you don't want to change what the button) I set mine up to open the flip 3d feature of Windows 7 with the press of the scroll button (this really helps me with productivity),button
"The mouse does what it says on the box:  it's extremely comfortable, the additional button aid in productivity and the wheel's free-flowing option makes scrolling through docs and websites much easier",button
"This scroll wheel, as in most (if not all) cases, is also a middle-click button",button
I mainly got this product because it is rechargeable and it has a few extra programmable button,button
Programming the button is a great asset here,button
I noticed one problem within SetPoint Settings: I had considerable trouble programming the extra button for use in a video game (e,button
"] Essentially, one needs to set the function for that button to be ""Generic Button"" so that the video game will recognize the extra button, giving the user the capability of setting a command for it within the options of the game itself",button
"Furthermore, one can set application-specific button settings under the Advanced Settings",button
"This sounds like a really cool idea; however, I tried using this for a video game, and it would not let me put the ""Generic Button"" function for button 4 and 5",button
"Im glad I did, its a good mouse, my only complaint is that they put this new Zoom button right where I used to click Back/Forward on my older MX Revo",button
and to hit the Back/Forward button on this new one I have to almost let go of the mouse to hit them,button
"what I did was re-map the Zoom button to act as the Back button, it makes it feel just like using the old MX Back feature",button
"Lots of button, second wheel is amazingly useful",button
"Plus, the utility to connect the mouse to the new receiver is for Windows only, but it only popped up instructions on how to do it, and didn't seem to actually do anything else, so for those of you non-Windows fellas, this is what you do: While holding down the left mouse button, turn the mouse over, turn the mouse off and then on again, and, while still holding the left button down, right click five times",button
Forgo that and find yourself some free button management program out there,button
My last gripe is the button,button
The button appear to have come from cheaper MX mice,button
"The only things I wish was that; 1) The button to pop out the receiver was bigger, and 2) The mouse would turn off automatically when the receiver was placed into the mouse slot",button
"I have found I have to click the middle button slightly to the right at the perfect angle on the part of the wheel that's closest to me emerging from inside of the mouse, in order for it to even register a click",button
"the only good thing about this is that there is a switch button to turn on and off under the mouse! [is, is, turn] [good]
",button
"Don't buy it if you are a Mac User, if you define your own keystrokes for button, they do not work correctly",button
The only problem I have with it is the left button clicks 2 times once in a while,button
"The only good thing about this mouse I found is the good design, nice button design",button
"This is actually not a great feature for me, as I like to use the middle button to open new tabs and about 90% of the time the button will slip and I will misdirect my click",button
"(If I had paid for it) If you use your middle mouse button for clicking links for new tabs, don't bother buying this mouse",button
I'm left with an expensive wireless two button mouse,button
) Here might be some reasons why the 3000 fits better to me: - The front (button) half and the rear (supposedly palm rest) half of the 3000's top surfaces slope at a greater degree than the V450's,button
"- The tallest point of the 3000 probably is shorter than the V450's, but is situated more towards the button than the V450",button
"- The 3000 appears oh-so-slightly taller than the V450 along the front edge, above the button",button
"Strangely still, the V450 is the longer mouse, with a taller 'peak' and a longer button surfaces",button
"The only problem (and hence the 4 stars for not being perfect) is that the third button, the scroll button, is too sensitive",button
"It may be my rough touch, but occasionally when I scroll, it decides to use the scroll button as the third button and use the ""super scroll"" (I do not know what it is called, but you probably know)",button
"I am not one to use extra button, but people may find them useful",button
"Some features didn't ""take"" when I changed the functions of the button from their native functions, a problem I've never had on previous Logitech devices",button
One of the button is set up to do an automatic search when you highlight a word and click it,button
The document flip thumb button on the left side is awkward to use,button
"The weighted ""flywheel"" scroll wheel is THE feature here - I don't like a lot of configurable button, but the scroll wheel is so excellent, it's easy to ignore some of those extra button",button
It's much harder to rapid fire with your pointer finger on the left button to fire in games,button
The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not have a power button and I am worried it's going to drain the battery when I am not using it,button
The Rev is nice but I miss the up/down button that were on the MX100 just above and below the wheel -- I wish the Rev had those button,button
"I realize the new scroll wheel is supposed to obviate the need for the up/down button, but so far I have my doubts",button
#NAME?,button
"If you install the intellipoint software that come up with this mouse, the wheel button click will show you all the applications in large tiles and you can select the one you want, thats very helpful for me",button
"It has the normal left and right button, a scroll wheel which also clicks like a button, and it scrolls left and right for spreadsheet use",button
Surprisingly good design of the shell has not translated into good button ergonomics,button
The extra button are there but side button require letting go of the mouse and oftentimes both depress at the same time (since they are exactly opposite of each-other),button
Even though they are hard to press they are not as dysfunctional as the two side button,button
"To summarize, if one does not need the extra button than the mouse is a bargain",button
"It works great, the only reason why I did not gave it a five starts is because it does not have a forward and backward button in it",button
"With that said, I will go through the Pros and Cons; Pros ~Sexy, sleek, and comfortable ~A wide range of button ~All button can be assigned custom functions (While playing a PC Game, I have 'forward' and 'back' button to adjust volume) ~Charge on the go allows for 0 downtime ~On-the-fly smooth or clicky scroll button ~Can literally be used on ANY surface including glass! [said, go, ~, ~, be, assigned, playing, have, adjust, allows, be, used, including] [sleek, comfortable, wide, On-the-fly, smooth, clicky]
",button
"Cons ~The forward and back button on the left side are SLIGHTLY too far up, so you may have to stretch a wee bit to reach them when holding the mouse in its natural position Overall, this product is amazing! [~, are, have, stretch, reach, holding, is] [left, natural, Overall, amazing]
",button
"Summary: Small and  awkwardly placed shoulder button, combine with a small chassis and stiff middle click amount to more frustration than enjoyment when using this mouse",button
"The shoulder button, often used for navigation on a browser, are small, and awkwardly placed, for my  hand, I actually have to adjust my hand position to engage the left button with my thumb, the right button is reasonably placed and can be relatively easily tapped with my finger",button
"Comparatively, my old IntelliMouse had large and long button that are compatible with a wide range of hand physiology",button
"When using the button to middle-click links, (for example to open in a new tab) often times you will scroll, then click, thus potentially executing the click off of the link",button
Only with precise and direct force can the button be used to any degree of effectiveness,button
"The people at Logitech who wrote the drivers, for some unfathomable reason, still wish to force the user to use certain mouse button in certain ways",button
The list of commands you can program for this button is much more limited than say the other button off to the side of the mouse,button
This top button had 6 main choices and an Others list of 17,button
"While the side button had 7 main choices and an Others list of 35! [had] [main]
",button
"I really hope Logitech's programmers remedy this, as once you see a cool button feature it's really a let down to find you can't move it to some other button when you need to",button
"It is configurable so the first thing that went away was the odd ""search"" button just south of the scroll wheel",button
Now I can see this mouse being minimally acceptable for users just surfing the web or general home use where big button and easy to hit links help make up for grossly inaccurate pointer movement,button
"I can imagine, that the forward and backward button on the side are not on the perfect position for everybody (like i read in some reviews), but with an average sized hand shouldn't be a problem",button
"button: I don't know what the default prefernces are for the zoom button and the button below the thumb, and I was to lazy till now to find out where/how i can change the settings, but i know it is possible somehow",button
I like the fast move button for the mouse weel very much,button
"It would not allow me to set the right button to double-click, which I had always done with my previous Microsoft mouse",button
I don't find the button as convenient and a button near the bottom left kept constantly getting tapped so I had to turn it off,button
It also doesn't have as many button but enough for my needs,button
The software also lets you customize button to do specific actions based on the program running,button
"Reasons I bought this mouse: 1) Wireless 2) Rechargeable battery 3) No charging station (charges via USB) 4) Logitech I used to have a Logitech MX Laser mouse, but the left button switch went bad and started double-clicking when I wanted to single-click",button
The button are well-placed and have a good tactile feel,button
"In addition, it doesn't get interpreted in the mac as a back button, it tries to use the menu like a macro or something which causes strange behavior if you are in a form field",button
"2) In the past I've had a mouse with the ""forward"" button on the right side (of a right handed mouse) - I liked that",button
"This mouse has the forward and back button on the left, in a spot that makes your thumb hate you if you attempt to use more than once an hour",button
"First because its too hard to distinguish which is forward and which is back, and second because you have to contort your thumb to get to the button, and interrupt your work flow to either glance down at the mouse, or just press the button awkwardly until you hit the one you want",button
#NAME?,button
Because I used it to control my volume; in it's place is a button that is used for zoom (I changed it to mute) and this button is so close to the back/forward button that I sometimes press it by accident when I intend to press back,button
They also added another button which is integrated into the thumb rest for window scrolling (I changed to search Google) which is pretty cool,button
"Pros -Solid build -Smaller, Unifying receiver -Battery is now user replaceable -Have not experienced any lag yet -No more recharge dock, now uses a usb cable with a separate wall charger Cons -Zoom button is kind of close and too similar to the back/forward button, Sometimes I press it by accident when I try to press back -They got rid of my side wheel! [build, is, Have, experienced, uses, is, press, try, press, got] [Solid, Smaller, Unifying, replaceable, recharge, separate, close, similar, back\, rid]
",button
Looks and button are great but that's where it stops,button
"The back & forward button are a bit high, so I dont use them",button
"The number of button on this thing make it great for gaming, especially if you download Uber Options",button
The button are much easier to press,button
"In fact, I'd say the button are too easy to press because I kept accidentally pressing one of the button while sliding the mouse around",button
The MX Revolution has an electronic scroll wheel can be pressed or scrolled quickly to toggle between smooth scrolling and click scrolling and has a programmable button just behind the scroll wheel,button
The Performance MX has a cheaper mechanical scroll wheel and the programmable button on the MX Revolution is now the smooth scroll/click scroll switch,button
The forward/back button have been moved forward on the Performance MX so the forward button is difficult to reach,button
I have to literally lift my hand an inch or so off the mouse and move my palm forward to reach the forward button on the Performance MX whereas I can lift my thumb and it's right on top of the forward button on the Revolution MX,button
Has 4 great button to key bind,button
"If you game you can count on 4 greatly functional mouse button to key bind things ( I am counting left and right click as 2, then 2 by your thumb",button
"Has all the usual features you'd expect from a mouse like this; configurable button, zoom capability, fast scroll, page forward/back for websites, and a nifty button to navigate through all the various programs/windows you have open",button
"The mouse has a nice feel to it, but it is a bit small for my hand and can cause cramping when using the wheel much, as the length of the mouse is such that you have to pull your fingers back to reach the button and wheel comfortably",button
"Now I can press the middle mouse button again! [press] [middle]
",button
Has a lot of programmable button,button
But i went back to my logitech M310 which has a cord and only three programmable button but works great,button
"My favorite thing was the texture of the button, because when my had would get slightly sweaty, it wouldn't build up on the mouse and I thought that was great",button
The dongl;e is made to fit in a place under the mouse which keeps the off button pushed,button
#NAME?,button
It was replaced by a cheap-feeling mechanical toggle button that cannot be reprogrammed,button
"Unless you have a very long thumb, this means that the Forward button will require some reaching to use",button
"Regardless, that wheel served as three button (rock forward, back, or press), which have been replaced by the single thumb button that I really like",button
"If you want lots of button to assign functions to, the Performance MX has two fewer assignable button than the mouse it replaces, which might be annoying",button
"As I said above, this mouse replaced my MX Revolution because one of its button were failing (I can't remember if it was registering double-clicks or non-clicks), and my MX Revolution replaced a previous Logitech mouse that had the same problem (the mouse from the Cordless Desktop MX)",button
"We use this mouse with our laptop, and everytime you move the computer on your lap, you have to reset the mouse by pushing this teeny tiny little button on the underside of the mouse by using an ink pen",button
"A button under your thumb to quickly switch screens, fantastic feature",button
"And button programing is more flexible than other mouses I have used, Microsoft and Logitech",button
"This is an exc product, great design, very comfortable, I like the side button to go forward and backwards on the web, the bluetrack system is GREAT, it actually works on every surface (I tried it on a glass table and it worked fairly well)",button
It has several programmable button and you can set up the options different for each program,button
"I did have a big problem with the Setpoint that came with the mouse and I DL'ed the latest version hoping there would be a fix but no, The setpoint would still reset the programmed button to default every week or so",button
"So, this is a mouse that doesn't have a middle click button in the sense we all know",button
I use the middle click button in scroll wheels to open links in browsers in new tabs,button
The scroll wheel in this mouse doesn't have a middle click button,button
In order to get the middle click back is to change what they've dubbed the One-Touch Search button to an Auto Scroll button,button
Auto Scroll is apparently what the middle button actually is,button
And I've notice that the middle click on the One-Touch Search button isn't a one touch middle click,button
Thank goodness the forward and back button are still here,button
Although they are/were only one button mice they were good mice for precision pointing,button
And lots of third party Mac device makers emulated the design for their two-plus button mice,button
The magnifying glass icon on the search button was the first to go within a month,button
The back and forward button should have been positioned lower--they're a bit elusive,button
"I have to say that this mouse would have been great many years ago, but if you rely on the third mouse button for anything, this mouse is not the one you want",button
"First, there is no third mouse button",button
"You can reprogram the search button as the third mouse button, but even then it does not work very well",button
It takes two or three presses to register as a third mouse button press,button
"tilt wheel/side to side scrolling, customizable button, and easily-accessible forward/back button for fast and efficient web browsing), but for basic functionality, this mouse simply cannot be beaten",button
The soft-touch button and scroll wheel are also amazingly easy on the hand when doing a ton of repetitive movements,button
Instead I've assigned the middle-click function to the Search button (using uberOptions drivers),button
But this is awkward and sometimes the drivers revert the button back to the Search function at random,button
The controls/button work great,button
Ive always had a basic mouse but now I know what I was missing with the extra button and the just the feel of it,button
The right and left button feel good,button
"The ""forward"" and ""back"" button are small and are on opposite sides of the mouse",button
I do like the lower side button and was hoping this would be a good replacement for my Revolution MX,button
Every button does something important that I choose it to do,button
The only reasons that I did not rate it 5 stars was I was hoping there would possibly be some side navagation button and a little better connectivity range,button
"I also like the two small button on either side of the mouse, so a total of 5 button, all of which are customizable if you install the included software (also downloadable online)",button
"There's a tiny switch for power, and a small button to press for the portable USB connector to fit into during travels",button
"The two button on the side of the mouse, near the thumb and ring/little finger are useful but not located in a easy to access area",button
"For the thumb button, I have to move the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 closer inside my palm to reach and press it",button
"I wish they made the button where the rubber indentations are on the side of the mouse, that would've been perfect! [wish, made, are, 've, been] [perfect]
",button
"I currently use a Logitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse (for notebooks), and that is what I'm comparing alot of the features such as button and scroll wheel to",button
"It has more customizable button, an asymmetrical shape that's more ergonomic (personally), and a non-shiny non-dust-attracting surface",button
first it was the MX1000 that had a defective scroll wheel button that only clicked 1 out of 3 times,button
"that's right, there is no middle mouse click button on this, and you cannot reprogram the button using the default drivers",button
"Would have liked an additional two button, but overall, good",button
Love that you are able to program all the button with the included software and works great with Windows Vista,button
"The worst thing I have run into is that when you turn off the mouse via the switch on the bottom, all the button settings you set previously are wiped out",button
"Good: Tons of functionality, the thumb button are in a perfect place",button
"In the Win version, the forward/backward button can be easily set as",button
"All in all, the button feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel",button
Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works,button
"For this reason, i reprogrammed the ""zoom"" button just below the forward/backward button to be my middle button",button
The zoom button has a great feel,button
"I tend to use the middle button for Google SketchUP, as it's used for panning the 3D model",button
"The search button is a nice idea, but I almost never use that",button
"Once it's installed, it generally does a good job of staying out of your way, but I wish it would allow more freedom in button assignments without hacking the software and/or playing with XML files",button
"On the Mac, driver software installation is relatively painless, but again, the software is pretty restrictive in how one can assign actions to button",button
"Sometimes the middle-click switch doesn't quite recognize that you want to switch modes, so you have to press the wheel a bit more firmly to get it to switch modes (presumably to differentiate the middle button from the tilt-wheel button)-- Logitech's newer MX1100 has a toggle switch that's easier to use, and works even when the mouse is turned off",button
"Finally, since the mouse will use the middle-click to switch modes, you may want to assign middle-click to another button for some games",button
"While the overall design is great and the scroll wheel is very slick, there are two things I find myself never using: the zoom button and the document flip wheel",button
"I suppose I could assign middle-click to the zoom button assuming SetPoint allows this, but even then I wouldn't use it very often, since I'm so used to using the left hand to hold down Ctrl (on PCs) or Option (on Macs) while turning the scroll wheel",button
"It would be 5 stars, but I just wanted to point out that there is no option to set the middle button search as a middle click! [be, wanted, point, is, set] [middle, middle]
",button
"There is, of course, a quick press button that removes the dongle from its compartment",button
The button have a nice feel and press easily,button
"It has a very nice feel to it, the button are useful, no wires",button
"Plus the position where they put one of the new button, right below the scroll wheel, and as small as they can make it",button
"I've scoured the net hoping to find a wireless rechargeable mouse that has a nice smooth scrolling wheel, that has decent programmable button features, and all I came up with was the G700 - which is way too complex for my needs, and the Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Mac",button
"The middle mouse button is awesome for scrolling, buy lousy for clicking",button
"So if you have an application (Like CAD,) that requires many middle button clicks, this is not a good option",button
I bought this mouse to try out with my new Dell laptop because I really hate the two-button touchpads on laptops,button
"**** Good 4-fuzzies feature ratings: **** When using the left/right mouse button and scroll wheel, both the 6000 and Explorer Mini Mouse are two of the most whisper-quiet mice that I have ever used, with barely audible clicking sounds coming from the mouse button",button
"But in order to make the mouse more usable for lefties, the forward and back page button have been split apart and placed on either side of the mouse; the left-side page button moves back a page and the right-side page button moves forward a page",button
"Since I am right-handed, with my thumb operating the left-side page button, my index finger pressing the left mouse button, and my middle finger pressing the right mouse button, I pressed the right-side page button using my ring finger, and it always feels awkward and cumbersome",button
"As a right-hander, I definitely preferred to have both the forward and back page button located near my thumb on the left side of the mouse, and this is how the button are arranged on the Explorer Mini Mouse",button
"To release this transceiver, you press a small button that causes the transceiver to be unlatched and a tiny spring pushes the transceiver outward about one-eighth of an inch and then you can grab it and pull it out to plug it into your computer's USB port",button
"Both are low profile, small mice with comfortably positioned 4 & 5 button",button
The Performance version needs to be activated/deactivated by a button and has too little mass to spin as well or as long,button
Pushing a separate button twice in order to stop and start a time-saving function is far less than optimal,button
"The ergonomics are mostly good, but the forward/back button are too close to the zoom button, and I don't really use the zoom much anyway",button
"I wish the layout were a bit different, and a few more button would be nice",button
", basic button don't take a lot of pressure) and that are pretty quiet",button
"Also, it's very difficult to click on the mouse wheel to use it as a middle mouse button",button
I rely on the middle mouse button for both home and work,button
"I also really like the idea of the thumb wheel, which is why I bought the mouse to begin with; it seemed a good successor to the MX700's conveniently placed scroll up and scroll down button, which I use all the time",button
"The whole point of having so many button is to make a mouse flexible, right? [having, is, make] [whole, many, flexible, right]
",button
"And it follows that for maximum flexibility the button should be easily mappable to a wide variety of functions and keys, right? [follows, be] [mappable, wide]
",button
"The SetPoint software that comes with the Revolution offers a sharply limited range of options for programming most button, thus kneecapping this fine hardware quite effectively",button
"You can't even switch the main left and right button(! [switch] [main, right]
",button
"I know it's a right-handed mouse, but some of us right-handers WANT to switch the button",button
"That was a really good mouse, despite the lack of extra button",button
Now we have less programmable button,button
And while holding the left mouse button down it will sometimes release then click or double click on its own,button
Several button you can program for what you need,button
I only wish that the side button were easier to use,button
i frequently have to press the scroll wheel down multiple times for the button to be recognized,button
the software that comes with this mouse is pathetic -- you more or less have to guess the button being programmed and use trial and error (i am on a Mac -- Snow Leopard),button
The MX Revolution had a button on the top just below the wheel that served as the One-Touch Search button,button
"That button on the Performance MX is now a ""gear shifter"" that changes the wheel from click-to-click like a standard mouse wheel to a wheel that spins freely so that you can move up and down long pages quickly",button
"However, the Performance MX has a button just below the forward-back thumb button (it is labeled as the Zoom button - a useless feature) that I easily reconfigured via the SetPoint software to be the One-Touch Search button",button
"I spend several hours per week browsing the web with Firefox and I use the ""One-Touch Search"" feature of the mouse very heavily - I am constantly highlighting the name of a file in Windows Explorer or some text in Word or some text on a webpage, and I simply press the ""One-Touch Search"" button on the mouse which automatically opens a new tab in Firefox and performs a Google search of the highlighted text",button
",  However, the Performance MX has a button in a location that the MX Revolution did not have - the thumb-rest area of the Performance MX is a button",button
The photos of the Performance MX shows what looks like a tiny button with little white boxes on the thumb rest area,button
That little thing is not actually the button - the entire area is,button
"To nitpick, the little button below the forward-back button could have protruded a bit more to give a greater tactile feel to its location",button
"Great size, fits the hand well, back and forward button, picks up nearly any surface for tracking movements and very smooth",button
"Overall, it's a very good multi-button mouse but not an upgrade though got a good price and very good for my uses but another user in my family who is a senior computer engineer will be looking into something else once his Logitech MX Revolution dies in the future from lack of details mentioned above and decrease of preferences in the Logitech Mouse Preference window (Mac) with this ""new"" model",button
"So, if you just do computer work like web, graphic, audio design or office duties, it's more then enough but if you are all into features and maximum button control, look further unfortunately",button
"I also love the fact that it has lots of button, but not too many",button
"you've got your back/forward button, a zoom button and a thumb button which got a overhaul in this device to be part of the grip itself, which is very comfortable",button
The one thing I didn't like is the fact the top button below the scroll is just used to switch between the regular scroll mode to the fast scroll mode,button
All the button are of course configurable,button
"I enjoy the frictionless scroll feature, and the side scroll, and the automatic explorer button is one of the best features ive ever had in a mouse",button
"Smooth scrolling or ""bumpy resistance"" wheel is nice - I like having that option with a quick click of a button",button
"Windows 7 didn't seem to install all the appropriate drivers, just the ones to get it working as a basic mouse (movement, wheel, front/back button), just not the extra thumb button",button
"It also has good button place (It is hard to accidentally hit the extra button! [has, is, hit] [good, hard, extra]
",button
Within three months of purchasing the mouse it started having an issue with the right button not always responding unless it was pressed rather hard,button
"The mouse usability is okay, although i dislike the manual button to switch the scroll wheel from freewheel to clicky wheel",button
"One big failing of Setpoint is that it does not give the MX Revolution the ability to use the ""middle-click"" feature that is a staple of virtually all other three-button mice",button
"My fingers should slide easily over the surface, the button should be comfy and smoothly contoured, and I should naturally find the button and wheels in a convenient location",button
"The shape of this mouse IS nice and comfy, and the thumb rest is nice, (though the MX 1000 thumb rest is smaller, it's more than adequate) but I find the button and scroll wheels to be awkward, and in the case of the forward/back button, actually uncomfortable to press",button
"Starting with the aforementioned forward/back button, they are placed a bit too high from the sculpted thumb rest, so that I have to move my thumb more than I think is efficient or comfortable",button
"You also kind of have to do this ""out and up"" motion to get to the button, due to the deeply sculpted thumb rest",button
"Second, the button themselves are, unlike the rest of the mouse, completely UN-contoured",button
"The left scroll button that defaults to a document switch button works as intended, feels fine, etc",button
"In particular, if I'm gaming, I will often squeeze the mouse excitedly, and accidentally click the button",button
"The main left and right button are unexceptional (which is fine), but it's the scroll wheel and ""search"" button that really irritate me",button
"Since the scroll wheel was completely unusable as a middle click, I decided to reconfigure the ""search"" button to serve this purpose",button
Other thing i would like in mouse is to flip through open windows or through tabs using extra button,button
Thought I'd splurge and get this one with all of its features and extra button but the battery life is a real letdown,button
Center clutch button lock toggle works great but I don't see myself ever not using the clutch,button
The button actuation is positive and feedback is excellent while the sound is just right,button
You literally need to place the edge of the button in the center of your finger which just isn't comfortable or natural,button
"only negative is the middle button [scroll click wheel] is VERY sensitive, so it'll magnify or whatever you set it to do, randomly",button
"It has true button programability and is not like the Microsoft ergo wireless that it replaced that had five ""programmable"" button and couldn't even run as a true 3 button",button
I resolved this comfortably by reprogramming a thumb button to be an alternate MMB and it works perfectly,button
Every button is easily accessible,button
The main function and button are immediately usable when you plug the dongle,button
I use the software btnx for all the other exotic button and I have now a 10 button mouse,button
my only gripe is the zoom and thumb button,button
"i really am super happy with it, i gave it 4 stars solely because logitech  hasn't made any easy way to change the DPI with out windows and installing software, it would be pretty easy to have pressing say 3 of the 9 button at the same time changed the DPI",button
"It has button, lights, textures, and curves that really make it look sharp",button
And the software makes the button highly (but not totally) customizable,button
The only negative about the mouse is the stiff spring on the wheel button,button
The keyboard is outstanding and as soon as I got my big hand on the mouse it was love at first sight that is until I discovered that the wheel wouldn't work as a middle button,button
"the various button for page scrolling, document flipping, as well as the back and forward button for web pages, are at your finger tips",button
"I absolutely love the Mouse 4/5 button, however the addition of another button right beneath those results in some confusing placement and usage for someone used to using these button for Forward/Back controls in a browser",button
I quickly realized that I prefer a standard 5 button mouse layout rather then the complications of having additional button,button
I have used some of the recent mice with additional button and found them to be awkward and left me prone to errors that took longer to undo than any time saved by correctly using them,button
I am happy that this mouse has retained its simplicity of 2 button and a scroll wheel/button,button
"The fit is near perfect for my hand, button are well placed, and it has a good weight to it",button
"Ive set all the extra button to the following for autocad; lower thumb:open, left scroll wheel:escape, right scroll: mute (just in case my boss has something to say), zoom:save, i set the thum up/down to move through the last commands (handy for when you want to go back 2 or three commands real quick), and right click: repeat last command (i prefer it to the spacebar for repeat)",button
What is also nice is the setpoint software that lets you set different button configurations for different applications,button
Which may be a problem depending on what you set it to in autocad if you use the middle button to pan around,button
"Now, if you have larger hands you will find the mouse wheel and thumb up/down button too close",button
The M705 is short one button (the thumb zoom) but besides that it is a good substitute,button
There's a forward & a backward button which are customizable to do different things in different programs,button
A zoom button under those two button which is good for quick zoom of an internet page,button
A slight inconvenience is it can't scroll up or down the page until pressing the zoom button again to turn the zoom function off,button
There's a program switcher button under the thumb which is also customizable,button
"It lacks wide customization of button, but for my use it is sufficient",button
"It's pretty simple, but very effective, having two customizable button that are well placed for smaller hands (like a womens or perhaps a dainty dudes)",button
"I've had these ""bonus"" button on many different models, but never where I ended up actually using them",button
"there are also three more button, a one touch search located just behind the first wheel and two arrow button on the side by the second wheel",button
"I have owned this for less than a day and immediately realized that there is NO middle mouse button, which is absolutely essential for opening and closing tabs in Firefox",button
"The button behind the wheel (Search button) would be a perfect place for a middle click, but alas, you can't assign that function to that button",button
And none of the other side button/scrollers will do it either,button
"on the flip side, before i started having problems, this mouse was great, all but 1 of the button (the search button) were perfectly placed",button
The second is the middle wheel button on the mouse,button
There are many different options for the few button you can customize such as the thumb button,button
"I used their (first or second) generation MX gaming mouse for nearly 9 years before the button broke down, so it was an easy choice for me to buy another performance MX mouse",button
"I've had this mouse for about a month now and this is a direct replacement for my other 5 button mouse, the Microsoft Intellimouse, generation 1",button
"My biggest concern was the two side button, but you get use to them as they are simply small and I am right handed, and pressing the right side button with my ring finger still feels really awkward",button
The software should offer a little more flexibiliy in defining the functions of the many button,button
The driver isn't as intuitive - haven't actually been able to program the button to the extent I desire - unlabeled button in the interface is the biggest problem,button
"I read this somewhere before, so I know I'm not the only one with this problem - does it seem that the right button is slightly lower than the left? [read, know, 'm, does, seem, is, left] [only, right, lower]
",button
"This may well be just the fact that I'm not entirely used to the shape of the mouse yet, but I've definitely noticed that I have to strain my hand a lot more to play with this right button",button
"My previous mouse (in case it's not yet apparent, I've so far been comparing the PMX to that standard more than judging it on its own merits) could run all of its important button (read: everything but the useless zoom) off the drivers - it didn't need the software that came in the box",button
"I eventually reassigned the two extra button to other things (I wasn't allowed to turn them off, by the way), so hopefully I'll never have to hear from them again",button
"A true gaming mouse would have nineteen button and it would be shaped like Master Chief's helmet, whereas this one has a zoom button and an application-switching button",button
"I might still have to send it in because of the right button issue, assuming I'm not deterred by Logitech's reportedly awful customer service",button
"The mouse worked perfectly, the wheel button also works perfectly, unlike the button on my replacement notebook optical laser mouse 6000",button
This mouse also has a better wheel button (good for middle clicking) than the newer laser mouse 6000 which is erratic,button
"This mouse has lots of great customizable button, and feels great in the hand, however, none of that really matters since it's got beyond horrible tracking",button
"Scroll wheel is supposed to also be a middle button according to the brochure, I but could not get it to work",button
"Who cares about Darkfield lasers when the rest of the mouse has too many parts and pieces, is too complicated, and has button in all the wrong places? [cares, has, is, has] [many, complicated, wrong]
",button
"If you don't need the forward and back button, the V450 Nano is even cheaper; I own the VX Nano and the V450 Nano",button
One of its best features is that it has a button to pull up a small window of all your apps (as pics) and you can quickly pick an app to bring it to the foreground,button
"I have only some minor gripes: the power button is on the bottom of the mouse, so you have to turn it over to turn if off",button
"The 5000 is better when it comes to button and wheel placement and functioning, the 6000 MIGHT start a bit faster but that's hard to tell for sure",button
"For those of us who use Firefox, we love the middle button functionality of the scroll button to open and close new tabs",button
"In this new mouse, despite its other interesting features, you must go thru some serious hoops to get that middle button functionality to work",button
"By default, clicking the middle button swaps the scrolling of the wheel",button
you must go to some non-obvious options to get the middle button working,button
but it is unfortunate that you cannot assign middle button functionality to some of the other button (say the back/forth button),button
The positioning of the extra button feel natural and can be hit quickly and easily,button
"My previous mouse was a Logitech MX-700, 8 button mouse",button
"ONE problem right away: no way to program the left or right button! [program] [right]
",button
"I use that in place of the tiny button on top of the MX-500/700 (corded, cordless) for COPY, PASTE and, in the case of the former, shift-delete",button
"IF Logitech (1) allowed configuration of the left and right button and (2) had equally good drivers for LINUX and the Mac, I'd call it outstanding",button
Idles by itself so I don't find myself really using the off button,button
Customizable button are convenient,button
"There are a total of 4 standard button, with a scroll wheel button and 4-way scrolling",button
"Note that when you're using the mouse, the thumb button is easy to reach but the button on the opposite side is harder to press",button
"By default, the left button is for moving back a page, the right button is for moving forward",button
"The primary and secondary button are very tactile with excellent response, and the button surface is integrated with the rest of the mouse shell, so it looks clean and ""aerodynamic""",button
The scroll wheel button is also very stiff,button
"I thought my Logitech G9x scroll wheel button was stiff, but the Mobile Mouse 6000 is maybe twice as stiff",button
The Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook 5000 scroll wheel button is about as easy to use as the primary/secondary button,button
"The stiffer scroll wheel button makes it difficult to use tabbed browsing, and combined with a jittery scroll wheel on the 6000, it's hard to browse using FireFox or IE8",button
"The button itself is very stiff, so I had a hard time trying to use it in Firefox and IE",button
"What Microsoft should do is reduce the force required to push the scroll wheel button, and add the clicking/gears so it is easier to use",button
Functionality: The hidden thumb button is neat and clicking is soft,button
"I would have liked the forward and back button to be positioned a little higher, but I am getting used to it",button
Just click the center button over the mouse wheel and the scroll wheel goes free,button
"I also give the smooth-scroll wheel, side selector, and even quick-search button high marks",button
Though for the quick search button I'd like to just associate CTRL-CTRL with the button but can't,button
"the ""down-graded"" version of the software does not let you configure the scroll wheel on your thumb, nor the 2 button on the side of the mouse next to your thumb, so I'm stuck with a nice-feeling, cool-looking wireless mouse that doesn't really have any more functionality that the other mice on the market",button
"The button feel flimsy and weird, unlike another other mice I tried: logitech, microsoft intellimouse/wheelmouse/basic mouse",button
I have extremely long fingers and find the fwd/back button easy to reach length-wise but they're way too high on the mouse,button
"However, I spilled some liquid on one of the button and it got sticky, so I figured I try out a different brand",button
"My old mouse was pretty plain -- it had two button and a scroll wheel, all of which worked pretty much exactly as one would expect",button
"The scroll wheel scrolled at an acceptable speed, and also doubled as a middle mouse button",button
"1st thing to know is that as a gamer I bought this as a cheap 5 button mouse, I bought the hype about the bluetrack",button
"I couldn't get the side button to work and it didn't track well at all, so I thought it might be a defective one",button
"I got this mouse for my notebook because it was one of the few mice available that met my 3 requirements: tilt wheel, thumb button(s), and a micro receiver",button
"There is a side button on either side for back/forward, but the one for your thumb is too far forward, making it hard to use unless you have your entire hand wrapped around the mouse, but I tend to keep my hand back slightly on mice",button
"OTHER THOUGHTS: If you're looking for a nice mouse for your notebook and you don't mind not being able to customize the tilt wheel or number of lines the wheel scrolls and you don't mind the side button being too far forward, this mouse is a good choice",button
"Nevertheless, it is a beautiful and comfortable mouse and it has a lot of options for customizing the button",button
"On the downside, it has one or two fewer button than the older MX1000, and instead of a replaceable battery system like the G7, you have to plug it in to recharge from time to time",button
The positive side is that the left and right click button are very comfortable to use and noiseless than other mice I have used,button
"Yes, you will like it if you like a silent scroller button",button
I also have to mention the lefty button,button
I didn't see anyone else mention this but it has a button on the left for your thumb and also one on the right so you can use it left-handed,button
The only thing I wish this had is a back/forward button on the thumb rest like some other mouses have,button
Also putting the usb receiver on the lowest positioned port avoids the accidental activation of the reset button on the bottom of the receiver,button
"I have worked with all manner of keyboards, mice (1, 2, 3 button and combos), trackballs, pointers, pads and other input devices",button
The scroll wheel located between the main button is really a flywheel,button
"Sure, you can reprogram the button but you still have to use your right hand",button
This is a wheel-like button on the side,button
"Highlight a word or phrase, hit the button and your favorite search utility will go looking",button
The mouse doesn't have any short-cut button,button
"At first I thought I was having computer issues -- and some of the issues indeed were -- but the mouse issues are: not holding a ""block,""  not holding an ""object"" that I want to move in a game, and needing more or harder or slower clicks of the button",button
The other day I decided to change the button configuration from left to right,button
"But I have used a mouse left-handed with my middle finger on the left button for years, starting at work because of my desk configuration and being somewhat ambidextrous",button
Now I found it impossible to use my index finger on the right side button,button
The zoom button is VERY close to the page forward/backwards button,button
This makes it common for me to accidentally hit the zoom button instead of the page back button,button
I just wish they would have designed the button a little differently,button
The forward/back button are very nice as well,button
My previous mouse just had a back button and I started getting frustrated when I'd want to go forward with the mouse but couldn't,button
"It means something large enough to fit your hand comfortably, allowing your wrist/arm to rest in a natural position; something that allows you to change hands to rest one; and something that offers a good, light scroll button and both back and forward button that are easy to reach using either hand",button
CONS: The side button are in just the wrong place so neither your thumbs or index fingers can comfortably reach them,button
"I'm switching to a Razer Naga soon, because of the massive number of programmable button, wired for no lag, and much faster sensor",button
A quick fix is just to press the reset button on the bottom of the mouse and it's good to go,button
The wheel on the side and the search button are mostly worthless,button
The button are well placed and overall it fits perfectly in my hand,button
"The pros (Darkfield, USB charger, customizable button, unifying receiver, free-scroll mouse) were absolutely impressive, and the con (click-scroll mouse is subpar) was disappointing, but not in any way a showstopper",button
As a CAD user that uses the middle mouse button all day this was no good,button
"Sooo if you don't use the middle mouse button I'd recommend this mouse, but given its high price its disappointing that its flaky",button
The major difference is the button,button
The loads of button on this mouse coupled with the ability to assign keystrokes to them makes this a potent aid for gaming,button
3)For Windows 7- Every often Scrolling button will stop working,button
"I want a mouse custom-formed for a right-hander,  one with multiple button so I can customize functions to my hearts content, and one wireless but reliable enough to be used for any application",button
"It's very important to me to actually put my hand on a mouse, to feel its shape and weight and button-positioning, when I'm shopping for a mouse",button
"These are very well placed compared to all the other mice I saw, including many that had only one button (I'm looking at you, Microsoft), or strangely placed button",button
"I was a little concerned that the button-action might not be very crisp, and I couldn't tell because there was no display model up there for the Performance MX, but my fears turned out to be unfounded, the button-action is excellent and crisp",button
"Then there's the groundbreaking features, like the program-select button, which works like a dream! ['s, works] [program-select]
",button
"It's in the perfect place under your thumb too, I wish more mice had a similar thumb button",button
"Loved the mouse it self, has great features small usb, on off button",button
"Other than that I really like the mouse, it works on virtually any surface and the placement of the side button really work well for me",button
"Also with the software, the button can be programmed to be application specific or global functions",button
The inexplicably awkward repositioning of the forward / back button leaves me wondering if the engineers are just bored and trying new things,button
The button are all very easy to reach and I don't ever seem to get a tired wrist or arm while using this mouse,button
This is a nice mouse with good tracking and several programable button,button
The thumb button is located almost near the very front of the mouse so it feels unnatural clicking it,button
"It's not bad, you just click a button to get the ""free-scrolling"", but MX Rev does it better",button
"Now, the mouse sometimes works, other times just stops randomly even though all the lights are on, new battery, and pressing the connect button",button
3) Extra button on the thumb-rest is nice on a Mac;  enables easy switching between apps,button
"In a single line: The scroll wheel of this mouse is CRITICALLY bad, and I would recommend against buying it if you like fast-smooth scroll or the left-right rocker button on the scroll-wheel",button
The Side-to-Side button (Left/Right) for the scroll wheel are too sensitive,button
"It's a bit big and bulky, but the idea of a rechargeable mouse, the smart-shifting scroll wheel, the thumb lever, and the other advanced features (several programmable button, laser precision, etc",button
"Frankly, I (and probably most other people) already have a well-ingrained method for switching tasks (the taskbar button or alt-tab)",button
"However, the functions that were available were either redundant (""go back"" and ""go forward,"" which the side button already do, or scrolling functions, which the scroll wheel already does) or just not terribly useful",button
My previous mouse had the side button laying directly under my thumb and it just took slight pressure to activate,button
"I like the fast, smooth, scrolling, and ability to configure the button",button
"I would like to be able to give it more stars, but the fact of the matter is, the side button location just ruins it for me",button
"It's now 3 months (and a few more weekends of travel) later and the receiver won't connect at any angle - even after attempting to manually connect using the ""connect"" button on the bottom of the mouse",button
"It tracks accurately on my oak desk (something my mighty mouse did not do), has great features like zoom, scroll (fast or slow), multi-window view thumb button (displays all open windows), and a side to side scroll feature",button
My problem with the device is that after a few weeks the right or left click button would not respond at times,button
"Every time I use it, I need to press the re-set button at least once",button
"I like most everything 'bout this mouse, but when I try to lock in auto-scroll using the wheel pushbutton, it depends on where the wheel is on its full rotation as to how much luck I have doing so",button
"Based on a few reviews I've read where other folks seem to be complaining 'bout the wheel pushbutton in other applications, it sounds like this may be an endemic problem with this model? [Based, 've, read, seem, be, complaining, sounds, be] [few, other, other, endemic]
",button
"The custom button for the thumb work well, and I've found that in many cases I can use them for switching back and forth from window to window easier & faster with them than with the keyboard alt/control-tab combinations",button
I do wish there was more customization possible with the button and maybe one additional button somewhere that I could fully customize,button
"You can map app-specific button functions, which may be handy for people who use one app heavily, like games or artistic/engineering programs",button
The only thing lacking is a back button,button
"The mouse is accurate, I love the free-spinning scroll wheel, (it continues to spin as if on a needle bearing), All the assignable button, It's heft, It's fit in my hand, the tiny size of the USB dongle, It works smoothly on most surfaces",button
Here are the differences: - There used to be a button at the bottom of the top wheel that was supposed to be a search button or something like that,button
"In my case, I used the ""Show Desktop"" expose function, and because the button was so accessible, it was very convenient",button
You use the button mentioned in the previous point to switch between free rotation or normal mode,button
"It wasn't a real wheel as such, but more like three button (up, down and press)",button
- You get 2 new button on the Performance,button
"I must say the placement is kinda odd and it's so tiny and stuck to the other much larger button, I struggle to find it instinctively",button
The other button is a thumb button that is the area where your thumb rests,button
"In my case, the thumb button and the usb cable makes up for the fact that the Performance is not as good",button
"Both of the first two mouses had left button broke after almost exactly 6 month of use, the good thing is Logitech customer service provided replacement right after I told them",button
The whole left side of the mouse where your thumb would rest is itself a button,button
"This button's placement is a little confusing, sitting directly underneath the back and forward button",button
I could not get the top and bottom button to work,button
"An application switching button under the thumb is great! [switching, is] [great]
",button
There is a button to change the scroll wheel from fast to slow and this is good,button
"The only way I've found to resolve this is by resetting the wireless signal, which is documented as a solution in the software, and easily done by pressing a button on the transmitter",button
"Only enhancements I would recommend are: on the fly dpi switches (like the G7), wheel button returned (probably hard to do with the free fly wheel technology), search button Firefox friendly (opens 2 tabs for each search), and more features! [recommend, are, returned, do, opens] [free, friendly]
",button
"Two years after purchasing this mouse, one fine morning its left-click button stopped working",button
"With the software I changed the ""quick search"" button (the one behind the scroll wheel) to show the desktop and turned the thumb rocker into an alt-tab replacement",button
"I also set the scroll wheel to always be free flowing, as opposed as being able to click and switch between normal and free flowing, so I could use the ""click"" to be a middle button which is useful to open up another tab in a web browser by middle clicking a link",button
"It kept disconnecting, so I constantly had to hold down the connect button (which is way too small to press with your fingers) and half the time that would not work",button
"also the range is horrible; after moving more than a yard away from the receiver, the mouse would automatically disconnect and the only way to get it to start again was to press the tiny connect button on the bottom of it",button
"this makes it so you can't just leave the receiver in when you are done using it, but instead have to constantly take it out and put it back in the computer (and then, once again, click the dreaded connect button)",button
"there is no connect button (thank god), the receiver is tiny so you can leave it in your laptop, and the mouse works on almost every surface",button
"Now it's gone, replaced by one useless button",button

I enjoy the extra side button as well (browsing back has never been easier),button
"Without touching any button while moving the mouse, the cursor will instantly jump across to the other monitor or some other area of the monitor I am using",button
"The options window for the right mouse button will appear when I have not touched the button and it will ""click"" things without having touched any button",button
roller button on top accidentally engages when i scroll,button
Preferr the way these button are setup on this one compared to old MX mouse,button
The side button are perfect at least for my hand and it is smaller than what I thought but it still fits comfortably in my hand,button
"The extra button are nice, especially the thumb button which I set up to initiate Mission Control on my iMac",button
"My fianc&eacute; uses the Anywhere Mouse MX and I was delighted by the design of the wheel; you clicked the wheel to change the scrolling speed, and clicked the button below the wheel for a center-button click",button
"As I use the center button quite a lot, I thought this was a great design, and it was honestly the deciding factor in choosing a Logitech mouse",button
"The mouse still works great if you just use it like a normal mouse; HOWEVER, if you use the middle button (pressing down on the scroll wheel) a lot for games/opening in tabs, DO NOT get this mouse because you really have to push on the scroll wheel for it to click",button
"- The middle button being more responsive on the PMX doesn't matter because you can assign the button below the scroll wheel as the middle button on the MXR and you can't assign that on the PMX, it's stuck as the button to switch hyper-scrolling",button
Using it as 2 programmable button is fine the way it is,button
"- Extra thumb button not really useful unless you are a gamer (again, wireless is not made for gaming) - 2nd ""wheel"" is removed",button
Only 2 button (thumb and zoom) replaced the wheel which is bascially 3 button and has more practical use because it's all on one wheel,button
"The perfect mouse would be the MXR added with PMX's dark-field tracking, unifying usb, and added thumb and zoom button with usb charging along with charging dock",button
It is too easy to hit the right button especially when i get weak also the range is a problem,button
"I have a mobile mouse 3500 which I love so when I saw the 6000 was supposed to be an ""improved"" version with two more button I bought it",button

What is different are the zoom and tab exchange button,button
#NAME?,button
"A solid mouse, with all the basic features (which to me include mouse wheel as a 3rd button click, USB receiver as the on/off switch), and good design and quality",button
After installing the SetPoint software I was able to customize the button further,button
Another cool button is the side wheel,button
All of the other button are customizable as well and are well placed,button
The forward/back button are both on the left side and are very easy to reach,button
The top button is placed underneath the top scroll wheel,button
The factory setting for that button lets you do a quick search of web content,button
The button location and programability of the mouse was exceptional,button
"Now for regular everday use, I have been trying to use it with my home computer since my M705 mouse is finally dying, it is still overly sensitive meaning you just look at the thing and it engages the button",button
"Just wish it had a back button on the side, that's the only thing I miss",button
"You can assign attributes to the 8 button such as zoom in, zoom out, mute, previous page, next page, and so on",button
There is a tendency to press the forward and back button (not right and left) without meaning to,button
"At the same time, the zoom button which is found under those two button is not something that at least initially you'll find without looking",button
"After changing the very bottom button to zoom in on print, you press the bottom button, then scroll with the scroll wheel in order to enlarge or compress photos or print size",button
I found my left click button had a small but irritating defect,button
The right button does not have the twang no matter how you do it,button
Cons: - The zoom button isn't necessary and gets in the way of pressing the back/forward button,button
I don't need a separate button,button

At first I thought the thumb button would be hard to get used to,button
"Boy was I wrong, once I used Logitech's software to move the mappings around a bit (set thumb to browser back and zoom to browser forward then reused forward/back button for other features) this became indispensable",button

"I especially liked the playlist functions, readable screen size and shuffle, even though these features are pretty standard these days",screen
"And to make that worse, the menu button does NOT bring you back to the previous screen - instead it presents a list of options - such as returning to the previous screen",screen
"I use the most frugal settings - screen brightness at the lowest setting, backlight set to stay on for 5 seconds (as low as it can go)",screen
Finally a razor blade (on the second device) revealed the screen behind,screen

"And the screen is 1000% better, and battery life 24 hrs instead of 15",screen
"What I find is that I have to hold down the power button for an inordinate amount of time, but if I'm patient, it will show me the Sansa splash screen and logo before freezing again",screen
It's easy to navigate the screen and import your songs,screen
"To protect the player, I just put regular clear packing tape over the screen and put black duct tape over the microsd slot once the card was in place",screen
The screen timeout is pretty short which helps a little but doesn't solve the problem,screen
"The clip was sturdy, the screen was easy to read, and the sound quality was fantastic",screen
I owned the e260 and I broke the screen on the first one after about a year so I bought another one and it got stolen about after a year,screen
"First, it was just hard to see the screen (the blue display got really dim) then it became impossible to see anything and finally, it turned black and I could see nothing",screen
LED screen very visible,screen
I'm on my 6th one and I just recharged it and now it is completely frozen with the power on and the screen lit up,screen
"For the purpose of what I wanted it for it was perfect--small, light, easy to use, it didn't have any screens to mess with",screen

Battery-meter is inaccurate and I found it doesn't hold a charge as well as advertised I found out that you have to hold down the power button for like 15 seconds for it not drain its batter rapidly after you turn it off,button
When I got home I noticed even though the screen was black and I couldn't turn it on (even tried the 15 second power-button reset) the Clip+ was quite warm,button
"If you move your thumb inward for a better response, you tend to hit the center button instead",button
button - Much has been made of the new placement of the button and controls on the new Clip +,button
"The placement might be an improvement, but I find the new controls themselves very much inferior to the button and controls on the original Clip",button
This has been changed to an on/off button on the top with the hold feature now on the Home button,button
I tried the resetting process of keeping down the power button for about 20 seconds amongst several other things,button
"Based on some suggestion on similar but different problems, I tried to (1) reset, (2) format, (3) press the power button and hold for 15/30/60/",button
"seconds, (4) press the power button while holding down the middle button,",button
#NAME?,button
I liked the layout and functions of the button on the old style Clips,button
The on/off button has also changed,button
With the Clip+ there's now a simple button on the top,button
I only replaced it with the same thing because they changed the on button,button
"Every time I want to skip to the next song, it's very frustrating trying to pinpoint exactly where the correct button is and I have small to medium size fingers",button
"This may sound dumb because you're looking at the player right now thinking, just press the button on the right side of the square",button
Sometimes I accidently hit other button,button
"For example, the top button on an iPod click wheel allows you to return to the previous menu",button
The bottom button pauses/starts a song,button
"The button are made of a matte, textured plastic",button
Although releasing the fast forward/rewind button a slight bit and pushing back down on it will result in the Clip+ skipping to the next song,button
"Press down harder on the button, although its smaller size makes that a little hard",button
The feature I most liked was that fast-forwarding accelerated the longer the button was held - which is handy if you bump the button and change tracks accidentally (which happened a lot),button
I pushed the next song button and the screen went black,button
UPDATE: Sandisk forum suggested holding the power button down for a minute or longer,button
"In Sum: Sansa Clip is almost too small to be functional (small screen,button)",button
Improvements over the original clip: - The power button is now on top of the Clip instead of along the side as it is with the original Clip - The volume control is easy to access - The menu functions are more clear - It has the expansion slot Things I prefer in the original Clip: - Ruggedness,button
"I prefer the round button to the square one and the brighter colors: silver, red, pink",button
"Not that any of the button are easy to use without looking, but I just can't imagine anyone being happy with such an awful volume controller",button
"Every once and awhile I would accidentally get a button pushed, but this new design will misfire constantly with the slightest pressure",button

I did not like current ipod shuffle design with no button on the player and hate standard ipod headphones with ipod controls,button

"Yes, it would be nice if it showed me date and time (especially since I can set that), and I worry that the slotRadio slot isn't covered and it would be more convenient to have the volume button more accessible when it's plugged into an external power source, but it still does what I need it to do which is hold a lot of audiobooks and music that I can listen to anywhere!

I love the design with a very easy one-touch pause-play button that is available as soon as someone walks in the room,button
"Something else annoying - the carrying case that hooks onto the armband (which is another $30 - ridiculous), had slots for the button on a different side than my previous unit",button
"So in a perfect world, I'd have to buy another case to match up the button with the slots in the neoprene casing",button
"It says it's meant for the Sansa clip plus, but has the circular button cover, rather than the rounded off square shown in the pic, which means it was actually made for the original Sansa",button
"It also has a lock feature, by holding the Home button, so it won't change songs or pause in the middle of your workout",button

If you want to force the USB mode (which allows you to access this just a drive on a PC or Mac) what you need to do is the following: Step 1: make sure the device is turned off Step 2: hold down the center button and plug it into your PC or Mac Step 3: drag all your MP3 files into the music folder Those the steps you need to follow if you don't have to deal with software and uses one drag your music files onto the device,button

Earphone Jack - The earphone jack on the original Clip and the new Clip + is in the same location,jack

"All three had same problem, with multiple jacks",jack
"I do really like the shuffle feature, the ability to jack it in directly to my car radio thru the aux in jack, a few pretty simple controls, and lots of features",jack
However I went out and got a starter soldering kit and was able to repair the headphone jack - it works better than ever now,jack
I've tried several jacks,jack
So I was going to just use it with the headphone jack and an AUX in; worked great for about 45 minutes then it just died,jack
I assume this stems from using the auxillary jack in my car (I use Sansa Clip with audiobooks for my commutes alot) as that may have fried the innards of the device as some electrical output comes from the aux jack,jack
I have not used other mp3 players as frequently with the aux jack in my car so I cannot compare with other manufacturers,jack

"Right out of the box after registering my NEW unit, I found out it needed a map upgrade, unfortunately for me I have limited broadband service, so 4 hrs later and 2GB of map upgrade, I begin to set it up, well there was also a software upgrade that had to be done before the maps could install, another hour goes by and then I get the message,""sorry problem with download try again or contact customer service, 4 or 5 times later, finally disgusted, I have to EMAIL Garmin customer service for help, they emailed me back saying they should be in contact within 3 Days",software
I'm probably going to return it to Amazon and shop for a GPS that has up-to-date software,software
Update: I am happy to say I received an email the beginning of July 2010 stating there was a mandatory software update regarding the freezing(reminded me of the 765 email that was sent a few years ago),software
"Many other minor bugs, hopefully to be fixed with upcoming software updates",software
All this after I downloaded the maps and latest software upgrades from garmin,software
"Not that this is a REAL problem, but the software took a couple hours to do the update, and it wasn't really clear if you could disconnect it in the middle of the update",software
The unit had the latest maps but not the latest software,software
"So I ran it again, this time telling it to reinstall the same version of software already installed",software
Cons:  Garmin advertises City Xplorer software for certain cities on their website,software
This software shows all available transit types for that city and the routes,software
"Anyway, turns out you really need to type in ""Avenue U"", because Garmin's software thinks the street name has two words: Avenue (full spelling) and U! [turns, need, thinks, has] [full]
",software
"The mapping software version is v8, the latest, but it doesn't have a few stores near my house, such as the Staples a few blocks away which has been there forever",software
The software that you hunt down seems mostly undocumented and it is one of those born knowing this experience,software
"The software from Garmin to customize the device needs a third party fix, sox",software
One of the first things the owner's manual requests that you do is to update the software,software
"However, after updating the software, the system doesn't tell you whether the update was successful",software
The only way to verify the current version is to go into a deeply-embedded screen to match up the software version on your device,software
"After attempting to update the software and map data, the unit went into an endless boot-up cycle (Garmin screen, map data loading, power down, power up, and repeat",software
Garmin software engineer with remote control of my PC could not correct problem,software
"Read is other software for the interface, but it's pc only",software
I wanted to be sure all of the software was up to date as well as the maps,software
Almost every major online map software offer that feature,software
"Now I write software for a living and get paid a lot for it, so I know something about computing and good user-faced design - this product could definitely improve a lot",software
"I updated the software, since one update was pending and everything went good",software
"*COMPUTER INTERFACE: This is a great feature allowing you to buy subscriptions, update your unit's software, and customize your voices & vehicles",software
I have updated the software at least 4 times and the unit still shootsdown by itself while driving,software
A good software engineer could have done this in a couple days effort,software
"There is software to record your own, but come on",software
"I have not tried 'eco route' related functionality I have updated map and software - so it has now latest firmware and map Basic functionality - add address/search address , navigation,interface is fine now i feel following issues - if anybody has any input let us know 1) when unit start - screen loads after ""I agree"" button ,it always make noise like ""spark "" or radio tunning for fraction of second and then it become normal",software
Garmin representative could give no date for possible revision to software,software
"All it allows you to do is to specify the places you want to stop at during a trip, but will not guide you through the Vias as the older Route software would",software
Seems the maping software needs to look at roadway types--like two lanes with potential of slow moving traffic--not just distance divided by speed limit,software
"The Garmin ""city-select"" maps or ""mapsource"" come with the software to allow a trip to be created on the large screen of one's computer and make necessary adjustments prior to down loading to the gps device--another feature I miss! [come, allow, be, created, make, loading, miss] [city-select, large, necessary]
",software
His software suggestion for the remedy is not available from the Garmin website for this model,software
Arrival times are way off by hours (the additional software was supposed to correct this,software
i have updated the software in the past 3 or 4 months,software
Either the software information on the device is outdated or it is badly flawed as sometimes it chooses route that appear going in a near circle,software
Note: software updated to the latest,software
"I suspect that after reading the reviews, Garmin grew wise and minimized the ads with a software update",software
"Where TomTom comes with software to update your device and to load different, map colors, voices",software
"00 and have the live traffic update and software updates for free! [have, update] [live, free]

"For some strange reason, it won't acquire satellites at all, resetting it and re-installing all the software won't help either",software
"I had the Garmin 2360 LMT GPS for 1 day, and the screen completly went dead, I returned it to Bestbuy and was given another Garmin 2360 LMT, and took that home registered it down loaded the maps and current software, that unit worked for a day and a half and the screen went dead, returned it to another Bestbuy, thinking the first Bestbuy got a bad shipment of GPS's, and received another Gamin 2360 LMT, did the downloads, and that unit worked two days before the screen stopped working",software
"When I wrote to Garmin, I received a generic email stating to down load the current software to avoid problems, I have downloaded the current software the Garmin 236 LMT was a horrible model, and graphics were small",software
More internet research showed garmin has many issues with the auto-update software,software
") gas pumps, came w/out-of-date OS software, user manual had bad directions & errors of fact & misleading info, even tech service could not get ""clear private data"" function to work (they had me try 3 different ways- none worked)",software
"I will continue to check Garmin website to see if there is a software/firmware update; otherwise, I can't rely on this unit for travel given its unreliability",software
took all day to dl the software i need just to update the unit and original maps - note to garmin not everybody has broadband,software
"how hard would it be for them to include all the manuals and all the software utilities etc on a cdrom with the unit? [be, include] [hard]
",software
Since all Garmin's use the same basic  software I'll be looking for a different brand next time,software
I received the replacement the very next day and was able to upgrade the software and map with no problem,software
"With the previous map and software it took only a few seconds to calculate the trip, now it can take a couple of minutes, and on a straight stretch of road the thing seemed to get stuck in a re-calculating loop",software
I'm going to contact Garmin to see if I can go back to the previous software version & map cause quite frankly this latest version needs some serious debugging,software
The only problem I see in the space is that several software makers seem to be gravitating to a monthly fee based model for the service,software
Since there are no software updates for this new unit yet the only suggestion then had was to do a reset all and see if it happens again,software
I wish I read the review about the defective software,software
My opinion Garmin is NOT strong with software interface with PC platforms,software
Garmin needs to focus on GPS tracking software where they are one of the best,software
#NAME?,software
"I boutgh this item based on a recommendation from a friend, in general the software features are ok, but I've noticed it takes some times for it to find satellites in Oregon, US",software
I guess I've been spoiled by the rich search features that have been added to phone based GPS software,software
"The update software sees my GPS attached via usb and recognizes the model and serial number but when I tell it to update, it fails saying that there is not enough room on the device, delete unnecessary files",software
"I uploaded the latest software in my Nuvi just a few days ago (October 10, 2011) and the distance is still the same, a couple hundred miles off",software
"I cannot believe that in the era that all cellphones come with GPS/traffic software, devices that supposed to operate better as they have been designed for this single purpose are so bad",software
"I bought this to take to Europe, then found out it couldn't download maps OR software updates -- not enough memory",software
"The next day and another trial:  This time it wants to know if, maybe, I'd like to update my Garmin PC software",software
The hardware doesn't work properly and I got stuck with an outdated version of the software,software
In hopes to get the latest GPS software I waited many months before buying the unit but was still taken by Garmin,software
"I then tried using Firefox and after 3 tries, I was able to download the software (the first time the software crashed Firefox)",software
"The updating process took about 40 minutes, plus about 20 to download the software to the Mac--and felt Windows-like (inelegant and not quite sure the right thing was happening)",software
"It took 4 hours to update the firmware, then download their special software programs needed to update the software and finally download the hugh 2 Gig 09 map update only to find out my Garmin 350 would not take the new 2009 map updates",software
I was on hold for 30 minutes and then I was told I would have to hold another 50 min for the software techs help because there was a major backlog,software
She told me I could call back but I would have to start waiting all over again because there was no direct line to the software people,software
"I learned (after going through Garmin's troubleshooting guides, several emails back and forth between me and Garmin's tech team, and a lot of time following the tech team's instructions to download and email files and install software) that for some reason no maps were ever installed on it",software
"NET installation, but the software worked OK under Windows XP",software
We are working to correct it in an upcoming software update,software
""" They were unable to tell me when a software update will be available and suggested I update my phones firmware",software
I assume any self respecting download software will restart download from where the partial file download quits,software
I love their interface - as opposed to Magellan or TomTom - and I was excited to read about the 3700 line because of its similarities to the iPhone/iTouch and its sophisticated software,software
It's thin and very sexy - love the UI software,software
"The software from Garmin is great, but until they upgrade the hardware, it just wont work",software
"For me, I am going to survive with my old Garmin until they figure out they have to have hardware powerful enough to stuff the software into without bursting at the seams",software
"Reroute calculations are slower than the previous versions, and it continously freezes up when I received incoming calls, that is the weaker point from new Garmin software",software
"I restarted the GPS, updated maps and other software hoping it resets things and nothing worked",software
"We updated the software, took the unit for a ride, and still it reported the signal it was getting was too weak, even though our functioning 3790LMT was awesome, locked onto it's satellites quickly, and did it's job well as always",software
"3) New graphics style- They have managed to make the same information on same size screen (I tried the 765, exact same software as 1490t) looks smaller with new menu button right in the middle of the main navigation route",software
It has a good sized screen and all the usual Garmin software features plus traffic updates (which I haven't tried),software
Will check out GPS software solutions for smart phones instead,software
"After arriving home and contacting Garmin customer service, each time I have been instructed to do a ""HARD RESET"" or update software that fixes the problem temporarily",software
"On the last trip, at the half way point I contacted Garmin customer service who said that I needed to update my software again",software
"Although I was not having any issues with the unit, the software update is mandatory, so like a good little sheep, I performed the update",software
"they knowingly sell a product with bad software, then expect their customers to cover the cost to return it to them for repair! [sell, expect, cover, return] [bad]
",software
Obviously there is something wrong with memory or software,software
"I called Garmin, and they walked me through a factory reset of the device (touch the bottom right of the screen and power on the device to reload all the software)",software
So folks at Garmin it is time to stop thinking hardware and start thinking software and firmware and give us folks a meaningful and useful update,software
The software is not lane-aware (or at least the screen layout of road does not differentiates between the lanes) although a screen-shot on the product page and the (same) image on the back of the box gives the impression otherwise,software
"Garmin has asked me to reprogram the unit and has sent the software to do this, I have reprogrammed it twice and have'nt been able to solve the problem",software
"Later in the trip we actually encountered 3 outright errors in the mapping software including 1 wrong road name, an omitted turn, and a failure to indicate the end of a road, with a required turn onto a different road",software
The 265WT is currently on Amazon for $30 LESS than the 1300 but loaded with all these features and latest mapping software,software
"They started the run-around routine: update the software (I did this when I first got the unit, it's been out over a year, there's going to be an update to fix non-starting units a year after launch? [started, update, did, got, 's, been, 's, going, be, update, fix] [run-around, non-starting]
",software
I installed all the latest software and latest maps - an easy enough process on my mac but today on its maiden voyage home the unit won't turn on properly,software
"We reset a dozen or more times, downloaded the latest maps (contrary to Amazon's comment about having the latest software), and reset again",software
"I know from years of experience with my Street Pilot that the inaccuracies of the software are many, and unavoidable: suggested turns onto streets that don't exist, streets that end in fields (Arizona), streets that aren't where the unit says they are (Sioux City), and being sent the long way around because the distance (undoubtedly as the crow flies) is shorter even though the drive time is substantially shorter if one gets on a major highway(Connecticut)",software
"Just a word to the wise, update the Nuvi software as soon as you get it",software
Mine shipped with a much older version of both the Nuvi GPS software and the Map software,software
I have several complaint about this product related to mechanics and software,software
I visited Garmin's website and downloaded software to fix the shut-down issue and it hasn't worked,software
"When I returned home, I reloaded the software to fix this issue(for the second time)",software
The speech recognition software is nice but really needs help,software
There has been about 100 houses and a few streets right beside my one house for a few years now that don't exist on the GPS but maybe I can download new software or something,software
"We have done all the necessary software updates, as suggested by support and customer service",software
And after several attempts to make it work (total waste of time $) Garmin replace it with a new unit that worked well for a couple months until a new software update was done a few days ago,software
Downloaded the update software and the software tells me that there is not enough space on the device,software
The user interface itself is very confusing and must have been designed by software engineers,software
"I charged it initially through the USB connection on my computer and then downloaded software updates through Garmin, including the initial map updates",software
There have been dozens of firmware updates to get this software working properly,software
Apparently a firmware/software update a few months ago addressed that and other issues,software
"Like every other software-based device, the first step is to apply the latest update",software
My 1390T does the same thing until several software patches were put out over 2 years but by then I'd like to get another one,software
#NAME?,software
"I understand having to make a profit, but older units came with pc software this unit does not",software
For $100 more you can buy this software,software
"(yes - I know that it is made for automotive usage, but it can be converted easily as a hand held unit with of course purchasing software for it)",software
"So I will have to update the map software ad cross my fingers that I can locate myself :) I'm sure this will cost money for an update? [have, update, cross, locate, 'm, cost, update] [sure]
",software
They state that the unit contains internal software and I can program it by using the unit,software
"Again I was told that it is built in, but I can purchase the same software for $100 to run on my pc",software
"I like the unit and it is sturdy, its just lacking updated maps and no pc software to plot your course to upload to the unit which I believe a unit this expensive should have",software
"It's a very stable device, more regular software updates, and less buggy overall",software
"It took a full battery charge while plugged into the USB port on my computer and eventually I was able to install the latest software and maps after a couple of calls to Garmin Support and some time spent going round and round on the less than user friendly Garmin website (why can't companies learn how to build good websites from Amazon and NetFlix? [took, plugged, was, install, spent, going, learn, build] [full, able, latest, less, friendly, good]
",software
"Anyway, the issue with installing the software was because I use a Mac and the supplied updater program doesn't work on the 3700's unless you go through a complicated workaround which the support person explained beautifully",software
"All opened MapSource software and downloadable products such as maps, map updates, travel guides, etc are non-refundable",software
"Unfortunately, it seems as that rather than building on the good, they tried to re-implement features with entirely new software -- for reasons unknown to me",software
"However, after a mandatory software update, the Garmin would stop recognizing my phone and was unable to renew pairing with the phone",software
"Finally I was informed that they are ""working"" on a software patch to fix this problem but they have no idea as to when it will be complete",software
I have 90Mb more after doing that and I could update the software,software
My Garmin GPS came delivered with software more than 2 years old,software
"Garmin's web site self help suggested downloading a software update but I could not get that to work, although a connection between the unit and my computer was successful, the file transfer failed",software
- Garmin phone support is good and they worked with me to solve several problems with their update software Cons: - Updating the unit's maps is a hassle,software
To get the current maps and device software you must download a proprietary Garmin Communicator Plugin to your computer,software
"Computers and software are upgraded everyday without us having to pay for the same features already installed! [are, upgraded, having, pay, installed] [everyday, same]
",software
I don't feel that I should have to own 2 year old software,software
"On the other hand, my Iphone, with Navigon software downloaded into it, would access the satellite in seconds",software
"And what really takes the cake- when I started to do research a year back I thought about the higher series but reading reviews pushed me towards this model because people said the software on THIS was superior, less buggy, more reliable",software
"If this is ""good"" software for them, they've lost a customer",software
Amazon sent it fairly quickly and I noticed that it had a 2009 software date so I had to upload or download new software to update the unit,software
rather than upgrade software I upgrade my unit,software
Frequent software updates seem to claim to address these issues and they have made improvements,software
"For example with Google navigation software on Android Smartphones, you can speak the entire address in one phrase, and the phone uses the google maps engine to mindblowingly accurately find the Address or Name of the business you searched for",software
"To remedy the issue, I had to reinstall the entire map software",software
I downloaded and installed the   latest software and maps; still has the problem,software
"Maybe with a few more software patches it will work great, but for now I'll use my new 1390T that I purchased today as a replacement for the 295W",software
"I finally recieve my nuvi 2370lt in the mail yesterday and the first thing I do is hook it up to the computer, upgrade the maps, upgrade the software, register the product, and do everything else I can (taking hours and hours of my day up)",software
"I downloaded their software which was supposed to make it easy to do on a computer and then transfer the route to the Garmin, but it didn't work",software
I will make one last attempt to update software before I return it,software
"The initial software setup and map update was painless, but time-consuming",software
"The most obvious ""via points"" to use are intersections along your route, but when you do that, the software invariably directs you to exit at the intersection and perform maneuvers for a few minutes before getting back on your intended route",software
"First problem:  Whenever I turned it on it asked me to enter my country, language, and whether I accept the terms of the software",software
I downloaded all of the most recent software and maps which took more than 1 hour on a fast broadband fiberoptic cable modem,software
Too bad the software folks that design the user interfaces don't get out much,software
"I've used GPS technology in marine GPSes, Android Smartphones, and on PCs running mapping software",software
"Garmin responded within about 24 hours (weekday) and gave me the procedure to update the software, save my favorites and do a full reboot (you hold the lower right corner and turn on the device)  This did not solve the problem and the tech asked for my address so that we could arrange to have it sent back to Garmin",software
"I'm sure someone will be able to patch the software somehow, but that's really shady of Garmin to set up the software to spam you if you want to use a feature you paid for",software
"The software for doing any kind of route planning on your computer, RoadTrip, comes very sparsely populated with roads and you have to buy data sets to make the software useful",software
Apple software folks are hands-down better than Garmen's,software
"They offered no constructive help, concluding that waiting for the next software release is the best solution",software
I received my GPS and expected it to have  the latest software,software
I ended up having to spend a couple hours downloading the latest software and installing it,software
The map updating software does give you the option to choose a smaller map (only specific portions of the country) if you prefer to do that,software
I looked up to see what the problem might be and found out that I have to get a Garmin USB cord (which should have been provided with the product in the first place) and hook it up to a computer and download some software etc,software
"Bottomline is they need to update the software to allow ""None"" for voice prompts or someother reasonable fix? [is, need, update, allow, prompts] [someother, reasonable]
",software
"The software seemed easy enough to use, but it's time consuming and I ran into a problem",software
I figured this model had been out for some time and maybe the bugs were worked out in a newer version of the software,software
"He had me connect to my computer and remove some Nuvi software files (voices,  foreign languages, texts, etc) that were not needed so I could free up space on my 1450LMT",software
"I called Garmin support, and after getting sent down a couple of blind alleys, I was connected to someone in the software support department",software
"Of course, the Magellan comes with the far better software that Hertz cars with Nevrlost also have",software
The service depart is good that they also upgrade the unit with the new software and maps,software
"On a side not it also amazes me that there are no other improvements to the software in four years! [amazes, are] [other]
",software
I have always owned Garmin and this is my third unit so I'm certainly hoping they will start catching up fast with some improved software,software
"Garmin, you owe me an apology but I know you are not really into the ""internet"" so you will never read this, but I hope it serves as a warning to potential buyers about what you can expect from the reliability and quality of Garmins software",software
"On a first Windows Vista machine, the registration software found the attached Nuvi find and registered it",software
A future upgrade is planned for the device system software to fix this problem,software
"I tried to download the latest software, since this was recommended under the Garmin website as an initial trouble-shooting step, and now my traffic function has completely disappeared, and the unit no longer even registers traffic info",software
"So right out of the Amazon box, I immediately updated my new nuvi software and maps",software
"The software update went OK but the map update failed with an ""out of memory"" error",software
"I got in the latest software, map, and restored Jack's voice",software
My unit had and has the latest software,software
I contacted the vendor and they had me reload the same software version and reset the unit wiping out all my stored data,software
VZ Navigator is currently available on the following Verizon Wireless handsets: Motorola v325* The V (LG VX9800) Razor V3c* Samsung a930 LG VX8300 Motorola RAZR V3m *May require free software upgrade at VZW store location,software
It's useless to me in it's current state of beta software,software
their software basicly requires you have about 6GB of freespace available when they could very easily simply download direct to the device which shows up as a disk drive when plugged in,software
"Each time I called customer service, I had to wait on hold for 30-45 minutes to speak to a representative only to be told that they need to transfer me to the software division which was another 20-30 minute wait",software
The tech support in software has no direct line so each call took over 1 hour,software
"Most frustrating characteristics: poor satellite reception, poor positioning accuracy, slow satellite lock, incorrect routing, unstable and slow browser, frequent system lockup, low speaker volume, poor camera quality, shorter than advertised battery life, no competent tech support, no software support, slow startup, route turn-by-turn directions screen missing, and very poor screen contrast in daylight",software
"THE FOLLOWING IS AN EDITED REVIEW: To make a long story short, after the initial two days of use, I downloaded new maps and updated software - - since then, nothing but nightmares! [FOLLOWING, IS, make, downloaded, updated] [long, initial, new]
",software
There must be a software problem because a friend of mine got 1 or 2 models down from this one and has the same problem,software
"Navigation software is the same old 3 or 5 year ago, you cannot enter a zip code in the first place",software
***UPDATE 12/6/2010 @ 10:51 PM*** Today I discovered Garmin's BaseCamp for Mac and it's an impressive piece of software for the money (free),software
"com, registered the device and was informed both a software update and a map update was available",software
It suggested that I go to Best Buy in Omaha for computers and software although there is a Lincoln store as big as the omaha stores,software
"I downloaded some software from the Garmin website, which wasn't very clear exactly what I had to download in order to optimize my experience but I figured it out",software
"I uploaded the software for lifetime maps, web updates, and some kind of plug-in that enables software updates to communicate with and be uploaded to the unit",software
"By upgrading the software I was able to add different ""language"" options so for English that meant adding male and female voices with American, British, and Australian accents",software
Uploading new maps and software upgrades is not intuitive,software
They told me to check in weekly for a software updates,software
"I purchased this unit for a simple GPS and it seems almost perfect until you try and do the right thing by setting up the free map updates software! [purchased, seems, try, do, setting] [simple, perfect, right, free]
",software
"First off, the software looks like freeware a 12 year old wrote! [looks, wrote] [old]
",software
"Get the unit and use it right out of the box, because if you try to set up the software and connect it to your computer it will tell you there's a map update that will take 40 hours to download and end up wiping out the map in the GPS unit leaving you with a brite paperweight! [Get, use, try, set, connect, tell, 's, update, take, end, wiping, leaving] [brite]
",software
"The techie changed my username for me, but now I'm stuck in Garmin's non-functional software",software
"But in addition to sexy hardware, it is the software that makes an iPod an iPod",software
My Garmin online account and software stated that all my maps were updated and current,software
Another more minor gripe is the routing software,software
"Email support, a day later get a reply: ""you must have a Mac, in which case, you must download a different piece of software and install prior to registration",software
"Manually restart the device after the software update is complete"" Ok - does this mean connected to the computer or not? [restart, update, is, does] [complete, mean, connected]
",software
"You do know that Mac users will be getting this software, why not make it seamless? [do, know, be, getting, make] [seamless]
",software
"(I have now read other reviews, and find that the very long update process, the crashes of the update software, and the inadequate memory to deliver the promised North America and Europe maps have been found by other users",software
I'm hoping a future software upgrade will enable it,software
"This is a decent GPS, but the bugs in the software and underpowered web site makes accessing the map updates impossible",software
"Furthermore, it is impossible to upgrade any software through the Nuvi 295w web browser",software
"I tried defaulting it and loading the latest software, as this has worked for some, but it still does it",software
"I tried downloading the latest software from their site, but it did not fix the problem",software
I bought this Nuvi in June because I was planning a trip to France and the earlier North America-only model Nuvi I had been using had outdated map software,software
"Since this model cost less than renting a GPS from the European car rental company for the two weeks I planned on using it, it seemed like a win-win -- I saved money while on vacation and I got newer map software for when I returned home",software
I sent the unit back to Garmin (at my expense) and was told that the replacement unit I've yet to receive may not have the latest map software on it and that I was not eligible to download the latest for free because the grace period expired - this on a unit that didn't work right from day one,software
I upgraded all software to the latest version but it did not help,software
"This unit and the other new Garmins are supposed to go hand-in-hand with the CityXplorer software, available as a download",software
"
",software
The visual of a major interchange sign made it so much easier to follow the voice and progress output of the unit,voice
"All in all, display is nice, easy to use and voices are easy to understand, but not reliable enough for daily use",voice
"Was very excited about the voice command so it could be used hands free, but that is only good if the unit actually works",voice
"We recently used the device on an extended trip in the upper peninsula of Michigan and many times Jill (the named American English voice) had no clue how to get us where we were going, could not find many addresses even on identified US and State highways, or could not find exact addresses when provided -- ""No match",voice
Fortunately there were other english voices I could swap to,voice
"This 350 has nice voice/accent choices, and its feature of announcing turns by street names is helpful",voice
So  consider  it  a voiceless  gps  or disposable,voice
However voice sounds like an 80 year-old lady (apologies to octogenarians)and the downloads for updates take forever it seems,voice
I recently used my new Garmin 1450LMT on a 1300 mile trip; (I've named it Jill after the female who's voice is on the unit),voice
"I would have lost the voice directions, help information, and other useful features on the GPS",voice
"I don't really like the trend toward adding unnecessary bells and whistles, like MP3 player,3D building view, junction view, voice activated commands (how can that possibly be anything but a source of frustration in a carload of kids? [do, adding, activated, be] [unnecessary]
",voice
"heading southbound on the I-15 approaching the Pasadena 210 freeway about 2 miles ahead, the Nuvi (in the British Emily voice) tells me to stay on the left side of the I-15, which I ignored since I already knew the area, and I had to stay on the right side of the freeway for the 210 onramp",voice
It rendered the use of the bluetooth and voice command features useless,voice
"Shortly after the transfer to the Supervisor's voicemail, I went back online to mygarmin to delete the unit from my products",voice
"The prompts are generally easy to follow, the voice instructions are good with sufficient time to change lanes for upcoming turns, and the lane indicator is really nice when it's available",voice
"Route calculation and recalculation: When I got my first Garmin, several years ago, it had a feature which that I found really annoying and drove me crazy: every time I deviated from its planned route the voice said 'recalculating'",voice
"Also when mounted, it wouldn't make any other sounds: no beeps or voice navigation",voice
"You don't seem to be able to use it for extra voices, vehicle icons, etc",voice
The voice activated feature was awesome and worked very well for me,voice
8 MB of free space (after deleting the voice and help files) out of 1,voice
when I voice command it says add to current route or start new route,voice
"I emailed customer support and they suggested deleting all unnecessary files like other voices, text, keyboard help files not in your native languages (free up space)",voice
"Its not accurate when it tells  me where to make a turn with the voice, you better watch for the highlighted road in the screen",voice
Excellent voice prompt with street names pronounced,voice
"But, you have to pace yourself and wait for the ready icon to turn green before you can voice the next command",voice
"But if you un-plug the power and use its battery (with fully charged battery), its guidance spoken voice volume reduced about only half loud",voice
"I think that one is able to download additional voices from the Garmin website, however, I think that this unit should have arrived with more voice options",voice
"I have had major issues with the 3790T, its pretty and worked well and all of a sudden would recalcualte, then the maps would disappear but the voice directions would continue",voice
"Time being short for Christmas, I had to choose a different model in a local store, voice is clear, like the older mode",voice
"*COMPUTER INTERFACE: This is a great feature allowing you to buy subscriptions, update your unit's software, and customize your voices & vehicles",voice
As to cell/bluetooth however I had to keep the voice /sound on in order to use it but I've had the voice off for 2 years on my old unit,voice
The voice is customizable and the volume can be controlled very well,voice
The navigational voice commands are great and normally very loud and clear,voice
"The voice is very audible in my right ear, but of course I can't see or touch the screen when it is in this position",voice
It doesn't have the voice commands but is superior in every other way as a navigational unit,voice
My Garmim 265 has a natural smooth clear voice that is easy to understand (very important when driving),voice
If they get enough calls then maybe that will be enough incentive to improve the 1350s voice quality if there is a problem,voice
PS: The tech tried to put the voice from my 265 into the 1350 but it was incompatible,voice
"I also liked the ability to choose between different voices with the TomTom, which the Nuvi doesn't have, although this is not essential",voice
"No selection of (standard/free) natural human voices to choose from--not even online, for that you have to pay",voice
"the screen is good, voice and  color are also good",voice
When the GPS arrived I turned it on to try the voice program and found this was the wrong model,voice
Now I keep my IPAD charged and ready with the voice turn by turn just in case Get the free apps from Apple and you can be further ahead,voice
too bright at night 7) i haven't found voice alert for over speeding,voice
"I use the Nuvi on business trips every week and several times I've almost killed myself on the highway as the suction cup releases, the Nuvi goes flying as I turn on a curve and the next thing you know, I'm palying hide and seek with some computer voice talking to me from somewhere on the floor",voice
The GPS's voices are amazingly natural sounding,voice
"Where TomTom comes with software to update your device and to load different, map colors, voices",voice
TomTom's voice has the feature that the faster the car goes the louder the voice gets and I found this to be a helpful feature that is absent in the Garmin,voice
"My wife has the Garmin 3790 voice activated version, it is a much better unit and much easier to manage since you just speak verbal commands instead of typing text",voice
This model has current maps and voice notification of street names,voice
"Our only problemm was the voice activation was not done at the factory, but a call to the 800 number was helpful and took care of the problem",voice
"I have since purchased the nuvi 205W, the nuvi 780 (for my wife) and the 885T which, like the 3790LMT, also has a voice command feature but it has a remote button that you strap to your steering wheel to enable the nuvi to start listening for voice commands",voice
"Because I will soon not be able to receive traffic data on my nuvi 885T thanks to the discontinuation of the Microsoft Direct service in 2012, I upgraded to the nuvi 3790LMT thinking I was going to get a much more refined voice-command experience",voice
"For example, the ability to jump to any screen by voice (such as ""traffic"" or ""tools"" or ""settings"") is no longer available",voice
"Had this been my first unit with voice command, I would probably be very pleased",voice
Voices Pros: It has a male and female voice that will allow street names and turn by turn to work,voice
Cons: The female voice sounds like the emergency weather broadcast voice on the radio,voice
The male sounds like the old robot voices from the sixties and has a bad speech impediment,voice
Also the voice choices are minimal and very unpleasant to listen to,voice
"Consistently hearing the ""emergency weather broadcast voice"" announce direction is discerning but worst yet is a male robot with a speech problem",voice
Overall the text-to-speech and the timing of the voice prompt is good on Garmin,voice
"But they still need a voice prompt that simply says ""straight as possible""",voice
"I know you can buy other voices but is it really too much to ask for one free voice that isn't grating to listen to on a trip that lasts more than 15 minutes? [know, buy, is, ask, is, grating, listen, lasts] [other, much, free, more]
",voice
"a lot of customization you could have, like downloading different vehicles, voices, or record your own voice",voice
Nightmare and is by far my most favorite voice and is excellent quality,voice
"Unfortunately, the device is remarkably insensitive to the female voice",voice
"An interesting aside: Garmin's eTrex, a portable unit more designed around the notion of hiking and walking, has virtually all of the features of the nuvi (and their other car navigation units) except for voice prompts",voice
I momentarily considered going that route (he-he) but really wanted to stay with voice prompts,voice
"), and last, the voice speak the street name doesn't work often, I have to reset preference to make it work",voice
There is only one voice available that announces the street names which is a woman,voice
"I would really prefer my old pal ""Dan"", a guy,s voice on the old Pilot",voice
for this kind money I find it disappointing to have not one other English voice choice,voice
"The spoken voice is nice on the Garmin, and the default can be changed to several different voices, even with British or Australian accents, male or female",voice
"The Magellan has a single female voice that sounds a bit like a drill sergeant, but ultimately I preferred her warnings and the tones that sound just prior to turns",voice
"The 350 is light, pocket size; lcd is bright; voice is clear; text-speech is great; play mp3 and photos even though I don't expect to use them very much",voice
"Issues: Maps don't appear to be up-to-date (yes, even after running it through the latest update) It sometimes takes 10-15 minutes to pick up reception Traffic is RARELY picked up The voice command feature is weak, at best The only ""alerts"" I ever get occur when a Best Western is near! [do, appear, be, running, update, takes, pick, is, picked, is, alerts, get, occur, is] [up-to-date, latest, weak, best, only, Best, Western]
",voice
"Tomtom is good and some even have voice and street turn directions, as well, but it might cost more",voice
"Over 30 minutes of warning with decent estimates of miles/minutes delay   Lane assist, very helpful   As one with visual issues, the 5"" screen and increased font size were much more readable   Blue tooth worked well, very clear and usable CONS: Popup ads are annoying but not horrible   Too many options/extras (such as voices) must now be purchased",voice
I was able to transfer voice files (,voice
"I did not like the default English voice or the voices of any ""girls""",voice
"*  Unreliable response to voice commands while driving, I had to repeat each command about 5 times and then it misinterprets what I'm saying",voice
"The sound quality (mp3 and voice) is pretty decent for a piece of equipment its size, and before my Nuvi went bezerk, it was really easy to use too",voice
"The voice recognition is a great feature thst allows for hands free driving, however, the number of commands are limited compared to a previous GPS that I have used with voice recognition",voice
On this model you can not call up a traffic map by voice which I find helpful at times,voice
"The voice on the GPS is also more ""robotic"" sounding and not as crisp as ""Karen"" in my previous Garmin Nuvi 550",voice
"Both have great features, the voices are great, but the Garmin is like a Ferrari that runs out of gas before you can get to a gas station",voice
"While I enjoy this device, I'm disappointed in the lack of more current technology improvement and poor design for the heat problems, elementary voice recognition and still needs major user interface design improvements in display and navigation",voice
"I delete the Spanish, French and Canadian voices (which, by the way, now means I can't sell this thing internationally in the future)",voice
"I have been led several times to frontage and side road destinations with the voice declaring it's success, only to find that I was a mile or miles from my intended target",voice
plan on keeping this unit plugged in at all times and keep the radio volume down low so as not to miss when Brenda speaks in her newly designed somewhat timid and tinny voice,voice
"When it restarts, all the settings have been reset, including voices and brightness",voice
With the extra room I would have assumed a better speaker but the old familiar voices are there,voice
"I like the voice turn by turn navigation, the estimated time of arrival, and many of the other features",voice
I have the Ford Sync(2008) and a Droid phone and the voice commands on both of them kill the Garmin,voice
"Next, I put the unit in simulation mode and tried to use voice activation commands to simulate routes, and it crashed again",voice
I seen if I could get a different voice but had no luck,voice
In my opinion my old Magellan  is far better unit and I love the voice on that unit,voice
My favorite feature is it's voice commands of where to turn gives you plenty of time to turn without having to make a last minute dangerous maneuver in your car,voice
"PROS: - Voice recognition works surprisingly well - Fairly fast with finding a new route - Nice voice, easy to understand - Loud and clear with easy volume control - Love the lane-by-lane detailed views - Good timing with the navigation directions",voice
"], noted the increased route and waypoint capacity of the 3790 as opposed to the 760, and purchased it based primarily on that (but also for voice commands and because I like the new lightweight design)",voice
"For example, it is not possible to list destinations 'near' using voice commands, such as 'near' my current route, or 'near' my current destination",voice
The voice commands will only display destinations near my current position,voice
"Also, the voice command menus do not list distance information when you 'find by address', so in order to get that information, you must use the touchscreen-driven menu",voice
"Also the voice navigation sounds robotic, and the navigation is not on-cue",voice
"And that navigation comes with voice commands, faster re-routing if you scrap the plan, better traffic avoidance - all advertisement free",voice
"As the return was solo, I felt the voice nav was an important feature",voice
It would be nice if it could xmit its voice commands through the stereo,voice
"I tried to delete unnecessary voices,keyboards,languages; the 2012 map with junction view still needed more memory",voice
"From the Garmin website, you can customize your vehicle's on-screen appearance using several different options (including ""holiday"" images), navigator voices, upload JPG images to customize details, get games (although for the life of me, I don't know WHY you would want games on a GPS unit) and subscribe to traffic updates (the LM means you get free lifetime-map updates, but if you want traffic information, you'll have to subscribe to that feature",voice
"The unit is easy to view  , voice is clear - Having this item for a short few months  I've tried it out here in town  such as going to church which is a straight shot EAST from Residence once on the main road , with only one right turn to navigate  - instead of going direct - unit wanted to go all around town before arriving at destination",voice
I bought this product after returning the newer Garmin 50lm because the voice is much better on the 1400 series than the entry level 2012 50lm series,voice
The voice command was useless without my reading glasses because of all the line prompts,voice
"Everything is so easy to use, plenty of info, I don't need my glasses to use the easy to use voice command",voice
"At first it seemed great; it's very thin with a bright beautiful screen, the 3d mapping is super cool in the city, and the Bluetooth and voice control worked fine",voice
The voice in the old nuvi is perfectly clear and smooth,voice
The voice in the new 1350 sounds like a PMSing woman shouting from inside a thick cardboard box; absolutely gawd-awful sound and extremely irritating,voice
"Then again, I've got the volume at 100% just so that I can hear the voice on a hot summer day in my car with the a/c fan crankin'",voice
"Ideas for improvement: I'm not sure what the higher end models do with the Bluetooth connectivity, but I'd love for this GPS to broadcast into my Bluetooth earpiece so that the GPS ""voice"" doesn't disturb anyone else in the car if they might be sleeping",voice
It would also be cool to hear the voice interrupt my radio so that I could listen to music and then hear the GPS directions as they are spoken,voice
"Finally, in order to install the newest maps, you -will- have to delete unneeded voices from the device to make room for the maps",voice
"UPDATE: 12/3/2011 - I recently purchased a TomTom Go Live 1535M and have to tell you that the Garmin menu system, voice commands, accuracy and display of posted speed limit and so much more is significantly superior to the TomTom",voice
The voice directions were clear and accurate and gave you plenty of time to anticipate your turns (the route still stunk),voice
When I came back to try out the voice command feature I found the unit stone dead,voice
"I had trouble the whole trip finding POI's and addresses, voice command activating without prompts, maps not fully drawing, the problems went on and on",voice
"If the voice command feature was activated unintentionally, we recommend you set a more complex activation phrase to prevent this from reoccurring",voice
"To reduce the number of accidental voice command wake-ups, increase the length of your wakeup phrase",voice
"To change the wakeup phrase on the nuvi 3790, please follow the instructions below: Touch Tools on the main menu Touch Voice Command Touch Customize Phrase Type the word or phrase of your choice Touch Done Once you are happy with your wakeup phrase, simply speak the phrase to activate voice command",voice
The voice activation feature activated itself several times for no apparent reason,voice
Loved the voice command but there was a frustrating problem,voice
"The second time I used the voice command, it restarted in the middle of address entry",voice
(yes I freed up a ton of memory by deleting every unneeded voice/keyboard,voice
Only thing I didn't like was the computer generated voice was not 100% crisp and sound like she was nervous,voice
"It shows ""calculating"" at the top of the screen but voices it as well (more than once sometimes), whereas the Magellan just shows it at the top of the screen but remains silent (which I like better)",voice
"One other thing, when I'm taking freeways/tollways and the Garmin tells me to exit, it shows at the top of the screen the name of the exit but the voice just says the name of the freeway I'm on",voice
"Unfortunately, when starting it up, I find the maps load a bit slow and and as I'm driving, the voice gives one direction while the display is showing the opposite, e",voice
"Also, more often than not, the voice directive is given too close to the actual needed maneuver and I miss my turn",voice
"The Garmin is worse than the Droid in the following ways: 1)  The Garmin's touch screen is much less intuitive/friendly 2)  The Droid allows voice commands, so you don't have to type in an address",voice
"I would much prefer the Garmin if it allowed voice commands, and if it had a better course overview",voice
"Anyway, I e-mailed Garmin and they told me to delete all the help & voice files except American English",voice
"The voice activation feature in particular is a special kind of garbage, if you insist on buying this GPS, do yourself a favor and pass on the voice model",voice
"There were many laughs to be had as we attempted to get the GPS into listen mode ""voice command, VOICE COMMAND",voice
"If you do buy one, use the screen as you will most likely get lost following the voice prompts",voice
"It constantly froze, screen turned black but I could still hear the voice prompts",voice
"So, I deleted all the non-emglish voices from the 1490LMT, after which I was able to download the entire map",voice
Pros: - GPS works well most of the time - I found it easy to follow with clear voice annunciation of upcoming turns,voice
Quirky at times and don't know how to stop the voice from telling me to one route when I know I want to another routr,voice
The voice feature has loud and clear directions,voice
The unit would indicate a left turn and the voice would say turn right,voice
"The volume if VERY low, give you turn info (voice) sometimes after the street",voice
The display of the current street name at the top of the page when navigating and voice  messages that included the street names at turning points,voice
Yes there are other voices but other units I have tried are not cryptic like this one,voice
Launching the voice Menu interface is easy and the phrase is customizable,voice
"Changing volume, and bringing up the Map Interface using voice commands is also great for keeping your attention on the road while adjusting your Nuvi settings",voice
"- Once you start using Garmins voice command, you'll probably never go back to manual entry",voice
"I hear the next iteration of Garmin Nuvi will include internet + google which should address this issue, but until then, if you're solely deciding to buy the 3790 based on the voice commands, then maybe you should wait a bit longer",voice
"When the unit was showing a right turn, the voice commands were telling me to turn left, and vice versa",voice
"It's slow, and I seem unable to interrupt its voice confirmations of its understanding of my voice commands",voice
"During our vacation in Miami, this GPS all of a sudden lost all map data, voices, etc and hence rendered 100% unusable",voice
This little contraption is terrible when it comes to recognizing voice commands,voice
as compared to the older nuvi 255W which had a much better voice output,voice
"- Hand free phone conversation: I can't end a phone call with my voice, it still needs me to press a button",voice
"A few of the voices are quite clear, the timing of turn directions is good",voice
"The voice is entertaining, especially when you go against the voice's directions",voice
The voice system continued to give directions but they were virtually useless without the screen to look at,voice
"The voice is loud and clear, the maps are accurate and detailed",voice
My nuvi 660 had the capability to download numerous voices in English,voice
I found British Emily on my 660 to have the most respectful voice when giving directions,voice
The voice command works very well and is useful for hands free direction finding,voice
"Overall the unit is not bad, just don't expect a dramatic improvement over previous models and in some ways (like the ability to download voices), it is a step backward",voice
"The ""voice"" includes street names in directional instructions",voice
The voice pronunciation is significantly improved over previous models,voice
"I found the voice recognition to be pretty good given the noisy environment of a car (turn off your radio when you talk and it works even better! [found, be, given, turn, talk, works] [good, noisy, better]
",voice
"You cannot pan and zoom using voice and you can't switch to the ""data"" screen from the map (but you can go the other way)",voice
"They should make a lot more of the commands available by voice but just zoom in/out would be a major major improvement for ""hands free"" use",voice
The voices generally are very poor compared to TomTom,voice
Garmin may have those features in spades but the childishly bland 1370 with its voices of exasperation and almost optionless interface does not come close,voice
"The feature did work and the voice recognition was able to correctly identify my intended destination but the command prompt kept coming on during the trip, even when I disabled it",voice
The map is very easy to read and the voice prompts are timely,voice
"Pros Nice screen (very nice) excellent voice quality feels nicely built and is quite heavy 4 free updates per year over speed limit warning Cons POP UP ADS! [Nice, feels, built, is, warning] [nice, excellent, heavy, free]
",voice
"Pros: Big screen, loud adjustable voice, easy to use, cool features like Point Of Interest and language options, readable color coding for directions Cons: Touch screen is slow to respond or doesn't respond at all at times I'm sad I had to return this product because I loved the pros, but the ONE con was enough to annoy me to the point of returning it",voice
My 760T allows selective muting (with a check box) of the voice prompts as do most Garmins with a music player,voice
"But it is possible to just run the unit without having a route selected should you wish to do so and as such there will be no voice prompts, as the unit will not have any routes it is directing you on",voice
""" I suppose then my 760T is totally unsafe as it easily allows someone to mute the voice prompts? [suppose, is, allows, mute, prompts] [unsafe]
",voice
"Bottomline is they need to update the software to allow ""None"" for voice prompts or someother reasonable fix? [is, need, update, allow, prompts] [someother, reasonable]
",voice
I've also just left the voice prompts on as it is preferable to dead space while listening to music,voice
"It is quite easy to change settings,route options,voices,language,etc",voice
You can also download language packs or use your own sound files for the voice navigation,voice
"I could turn the sound on the unit up all the way and the voice navigation and sound effects would be extremely loud, but I could barely hear the person speaking",voice
"He had me connect to my computer and remove some Nuvi software files (voices,  foreign languages, texts, etc) that were not needed so I could free up space on my 1450LMT",voice
"I have a need for something that gives clear-voiced, efficient directions, and provides a readable screen in sunlight",voice
I just wanted something to read clear-voiced efficient directions to me while I'm driving,voice
The suggested way to gain memory space was to delete different voices,voice
"I deleted about 9 of the 20 or so different voice files, including Canadian French and European Spanish",voice
"Using the same process to look at the voices on my older Garmin nuvi 260W, I found that it had at least 80 voices, including Chinese, Bulgarian, Portuguese, and on and on",voice
"How could this old unit handle so many more voice files than this less than 2-year-old unit? [handle] [old, many, more, less, 2-year-old]
",voice
I actually prefer my old Tom Tom for the choice of voices and the ease of checking your overall route - maybe I just haven't figured the Garmin out yet though,voice
"I like the voice commands of the 2360, a big improvement over prior voice-commanded units",voice
"However, even with voice commands you do have to at times be able to read the map clearly",voice
"I tried different voices, volume levels, etc",voice
"First off, it only has three preinstalled voices:  American English, Spanish and French Canadian- nothing else",voice
"Apparently, to get other voices, including my old favorite Aussie Karen, you have to download the voice from Garmin's website",voice
"I literally spent hours downloading installers, drivers, voices and maps, each using a different and well hidden links, to unsuccessfully complete any task",voice
good morning sent me the invoice and the product without need to send the package to Venezuela,voice
I would have to say voice command and then raise my voice or lower it until the unit decided it was the right pitch,voice
But I could still count on the voice except when it was telling me the wrong direction to turn,voice
"Here is my first impressions:  I found I liked the voice activated feature for initiating or ""cancelling"" a route while driving which I thought was not going to be useful",voice
The navigational voice on the 3790 was more accurate than the 260W which mispronounced more street names,voice
The volume of projected voice was good,voice
The voice command will activate when you are having casual conversations with someone in the car,voice
One thing that we find humorous is the Garmin's voice,voice
"Garmin Support eventually insisted in speaking to me directly over the phone, and they talked me through the deletion of numerous items such as foreign language voice support from the nuvi, as the issue seemed to be a memory management issue, although a side issue has to do with the USB interface maxing out the 500 ma capacity of normal PC USB ports",voice
") Anyway, I later discovered that as a side effect of the ""trash clean-up"" that it had deleted the ""Jack voice"" which I find cleaner to hear than the default ""Jill voice""",voice
"vpm files are the large voice files, and unneeded ones can be deleted (e",voice
"I got in the latest software, map, and restored Jack's voice",voice
"I thought this was a good unit until while on a trip from South FL to New Orleans it began freezing up once an hour or so, that is, not updating the screen or giving voice commands",voice
"I like the voice announcement of the upcoming turns, and haven't had much issue with instructions given too late to use",voice
"This unit constantly freezes up, reboots, stutters when it talks and often times it will not even load the voice files leaving it and myself speechless",voice
"what's bright enough for the day, is blinding at night; what is good at night is washed out during the day > Allow myGarmin part of the website to design the interface - allow me to move items around, exclude them, or change font sizes/types for greater readability > Change the way lane assist (in the upper left) works - use the lanes that exist 1-2 miles before the exit, not the number of lanes in the exit > Keep the lane assist (full screen) pop up on the screen longer - or allow voice activation to bring it back > The unit will just start speaking directions with no warning - if you're driving with the radio on, you have no chance to turn it down - have the Garmin use the speaker as a microphone to detect the loud sound condition and amplify the speaker (and/or flash the screen 3 times before speaking to get your attention so you can turn the radio down) > Allow use of unit in portrait mode, not just landscape so you get more downfield view of the route > Offer an accelerometer that auto-detects rotation from landscape to portrait (need to first allow use of portrait orientation as suggested above) > Put a distance scale on the screen > Put a rechargeable battery pack into the friction mount to boost the longevity of the GPS unit!

",voice
It's mostly difficult to hear voices during a conversation esp,voice
"I really wanted hands off phone and that's sort of IFFy , because the voice recognition is iffy",voice
The voice works near 100% when it is basic commands,voice
"The online support is no help either and the so far today, Tuesday, support telephone is only voice mail",voice
"The voice prompts come at the (at least for me) wrong moments, the used arrows are unclear (often it seems to be pointing forward and left/right at the same time)",voice
"It's slimmer, the map displays are more versatile and sophisticated, vocal directions are louder, it has Bluetooth, it's more responsive to voice command, and you don't need a button to activate voice command",voice
Similarly both the male and female voices are easy to understand with clear pronounciations,voice
"""  I found her digital voice otherwise pleasant enough",voice
"By upgrading the software I was able to add different ""language"" options so for English that meant adding male and female voices with American, British, and Australian accents",voice
"While driving, the person you are conversing with sounds garbled, the speaker isn't loud enough, and the voice of the person you're talking to reverberates back through the microphone and they hear an echo / feedback",voice
The nice thing about using the StreetAtlas is that it has EXCELLENT voice navigation ability but you have to bring your laptop along which is kind of a drag,voice
"When using voice navigation to search for a place, there is NO option to search near the current route, near destination, near a different city",voice
So this is really a turn off as I have to now use the manual search instead of the using the voice navigation,voice
"I've only fussed with it for a day, but it's not obvious to me what the advantages are over my older unit other than voice commands",voice
On the positive side the voice recognition seems to work well,voice
"The number of things you can control with voice commands; however, is somewhat limited",voice
"All in all, unless you want the voice recognition feature (which, with practice, is probably nice) I say get one of the older cheaper models",voice
Never did figure out the voice command for finding destinations in other cities,voice
"The voice is an irritating ""woman's"" voice that sounds suspiciously like a former mother in law of mine",voice
It insists on taking the longest route possible and the mother-in-law voice has a certain grating quality that is very nasty sounding,voice
"When I have insisted on driving what I know to be the shorter route several times the voice says ""recalculating"" with a very impatient, almost grating sound to it as though it it somehow angry that I am not obeying its directives",voice
I opted for the Lifetime free map update and one of the reasons I went with this model was the voice turn by turn ability,voice
The voice assisted turns are inconsistent,voice
"Once it locks on, sometimes the voice is very distorted and unintelligible",voice
You will get very frustrated trying to get the voice commands to work and then you'll give up,voice
"I removed a number of files (everything that was in languages other than English, voice, etc",voice
voice is clear,voice
The voice changes from man to woman and silent without my touching it,voice

I've had my 2360LMT for a few weeks now and am generally happy with the direction it provides and most of the features,direction
After about 5mins the unit will show the direction where I'm driving but the map will be blank,direction
"The TomTom has better stat display, such as total remaining travel distance, estimated arrival time, travel distance until next direction, and current time",direction
I have a a garmin 265 and it always finds the best direction,direction
"The Garmin Nuvi 1350LMT looks good, sounds good, and gives accurate direction",direction
"Once we FINALLY arrived at our destination and looked it up on Google Maps, we would ignore the Garmin, take an easy, straight route on major roads (2 lanes each direction with a turning lane) through town to a much closer exit off H1",direction
"However, when it comes to precise direction and IMPORTANT, telling whether your destination is on the right or left - Garmin has it over Tom Tom",direction
"Still, at the end of the day, with all of the sex-appeal stripped away, I bought a GPS unit for direction and navigation, and the Garmin 3790 does not do a good job with that fundamental task",direction
"At least in Seattle region, a very simple route is never given, although Garmin makes this claim: ""On compatible devices, provides enhanced pedestrian mode -- street direction that use any available forms of public transportation: bus, subway, metrorail, tramway, taxi and more",direction
"I returned the unit, got a Droid and couldn't be happier, since Google provides for free not only turn to turn direction, and traffic but detailed mass transit informations, plus I have an app that gives me exact bus arrival and any delays",direction
"it sounds like it would be, but for instance, it'll highlight that i can be in any of the three left lanes but then the next step of the direction will tell me to take an exit, making it difficult if i had been in the very far left lane",direction
"We were going south and chose a highway that went south, but the north direction was only about 5 miles until it hit the highway we needed to go south",direction
"You can go pretty far in 5 minutes, so hopefully you're going in the right direction",direction
"I love the user friendliness, the accuracy of direction , and some of the great features such as  turn by turn direction, junction view , etc",direction
"I am frequently EMBARRASSED when I have friends in the car because this device does such stupid things sometimes, but because I really have the worst sense of direction of any person on earth I blindly follow it's ridiculous commands because I don't know how else to get to my destination! [am, EMBARRASSED, have, does, have, follow, 's, do, know, get] [such, stupid, worst, ridiculous, else]
",direction
", driving map would disappear) but it would still be talking out the turn-by-turn direction",direction
"this one looked pretty simple and easy to use - it also has the bonus of walking direction which i thought they'd really like since they take their dog on long walks, sometimes in unfamiliar towns",direction
"from what i did see of the actual gps function (direction, maps, etc) this unit would be great if the screen worked properly",direction
bottom line: i would have recommended this gps to others if the screen worked - especially because it has walking direction which i thought was a really nice addition,direction
"because the screen does not work, i will instead recommend the garmin nuvi 50 which is very similar to this one - the only difference i noticed (aside from the fact that the screen has a very good touch response) is that it does not have 'pedestrian mode' which gives the walking direction",direction
"I would have lost the voice direction, help information, and other useful features on the GPS",direction
If I stray only a bit off the defined path the direction tell me to turn off at the next intersection and return home or some other place,direction
"The maps are of little use; the direction better, but I am not willing to put blind faith in this mechanism nor is my wife",direction
"In 2 different subdivisions, it only showed the street names for the streets that were going to same direction as me; most intersecting streets you saw the lines for them on the map, but no street names",direction
I am going to reread the direction again - but overall very disappointed,direction
"Second, when you miss a turn or a direction, it recalculates some long, drawn-out new route when it would just be easier to turn around",direction
"This is especially bad for a female user, because research indicate that women rely more on landmarks than men in figuring out the direction",direction
"I did not want to get ticketed by Police, so I took a U-turn on Waterford Parkway South and followed the direction of the Roadmate 1475T entering I-95 via correct entrance",direction
"The Good: This unit is full-featured, reasonably-priced (within my budget, anyway), and easy to use for point-to-point direction",direction
Ex: providing direction that required me to drive north in order to head toward a location due south of my starting point,direction
"But here's the deal:  When I forgot the spoken direction, I could not understand what I was to do next by simply looking at the screen",direction
"The traffic is usually off, scrolling through the map screens is HORRIBLE, the GPS will just shut off in mid route (happened when we really needed direction in a city and thus got lost) and the estimated time is off by 1 hr",direction
"Unfortunately, that unit has terrible TTS, so I may use distance and direction announcements only and skip the street names, but I got this thing to keep from getting lost and I've taken more bad turns and odd routes with the Garmin 1300 than I ever did on my own",direction
We were able to choose direction in a multiple of languages,direction
My US direction were spot on & saved us some driving time,direction
"So I put my finger on the screen, wait for a second, then slowly move it in the desired direction",direction
Overall I am disappointed in this product and have had several situations where I have been delayed because it took me off a highway for no reason where there was no onramp back or I had to print out direction because it refused to allow for an alternate route,direction
"Whilst I search for a replacement for this decidedly less than adequate unit, I've resorted to following printed direction from Google Maps, or risking sanctions from other family members and grabbing an older unit from one of our other automobiles",direction
Including the street I live on which was changed from a 2 mile circle (which it is ) to a circle with a break in it so that the direction and mileages were longer and higher than the accurate ones,direction
"Both at key times, once when I had to call my husband at 5:00 AM in order to get direction",direction
The turn by turn direction were great as it gives you a written note of the next turn and how long along with the side of the road,direction
I've been directionally challenged my whole life & this was FANTASTIC,direction
"I will say this, the ads that people complain about: i don't see what the big deal is, they're tiny, they occasionally pop up & never interfere w/ the screen or direction",direction
On local streets other strange direction would have me drive a couple of blocks out of my way apparently because these are major streets as opposed to taking a less traveled side street,direction
I would rather use google map at home and get direction before i head to my destination location,direction
I had the old Garmin V for ages and for the past couple of years was using the Verizon Wireless VZ Navigator service for turn-by-turn direction and searching for services -- it is quite good,direction
Fractured and sometimes hard to understand speech on the turn-by-turn direction,direction
"It constantly confuses service roads and highways, direction of travel and current location",direction
"I pulled out the TomTom and ran them side by side since I knew TomTom at least was familiar with the area and when Garmin told me to go straight and TomTom to turn, I followed the TomTom, but within a minute after that their direction were consistent with each other",direction
"Turn information: Occasionally, I like to see what direction I will need to take ahead of time and with the Garmin it is an easy one screen push operation, with my TomTom I have to do about 3 or 4 button pushes to get to the right screen (though the TomTom does have more choices like seeing it in text, map images or through a moving driving demo going through the map as you would be whilst driving)",direction
It is certainly better than TomTom in some respects as I have noted but initial impressions are important and I think it certainly needs some work in the map direction area which is its main function,direction
The direction were pretty good and consistent as long as I was driving on a major thoroughfare,direction
we should have just used  the aaa triptik (after it is cross checked via driving direction from two other sites),direction
I knew I was to turn left and it picked up direction from there,direction
"* The Garmin's use of space on the display is quite inefficient if you want to display stats like driving direction, time to destination, etc",direction
"The reasons I began looking for a new GPS are wanted new features, such as spoken direction, street names and lane guide/assistance",direction
"It shows speed limit and current speed and one other detail that you can choose from such as distance to destination, time to destination, direction of travel, elevation, and a couple more",direction
"Consistently hearing the ""emergency weather broadcast voice"" announce direction is discerning but worst yet is a male robot with a speech problem",direction
"Garmin is moving in the right direction, but they failed on this one",direction
I have been a big fan of GPS for years - I am 'directionally challenged' and the Garmin products have been a blessing for me,direction
Don't just assume it's right all the time and blindly follow it's direction even on major roads,direction
"All this makes it almost impossible to use it as a map replacement for walking in a city even with extended city maps for ""enhanced"" walking direction (tried it in Amsterdam - not very helpful)",direction
"Also, it is not easy to re-direct the driving direction",direction
Device is quick at producing direction and also at rerouting,direction
"Screen size is decent, didn't have any trouble seeing the maps/direction",direction
A good unit will find the nearest Mcdonalds and based on your current location give you direction to it,direction
"If it kept us on good street or in our area waht we call ""Snow Routes"" or ""Emergency Routes"" I would feel more comfortable following their direction",direction
"It also happened already once that after passing a tunnel it lost signal and then it wasn't able to find any satellite until it finally stopped working, we ended up pulling over to try to find the address with my cell's GPS, about 1 hr later it came back to life and continued providing driving direction like nothing happended, of course we were already at the restaurant having dinner",direction
"(4) The speaker is tiny, requiring intense attention to spoken direction under normal road noise conditions",direction
"Executive Summary: TomToms and Garmins are both very good products, but after trying both I found the Garmin lacking because:   - the Garmin was only minimally configurable   - because of the minimal configuration there is no way on a route with the nuvi to see all of: current speed; ETA; compass; map; distance left to destination; distance to next turn; direction of turn",direction
"If you're not on a route, the bottom right shows direction",direction
"When I'm traveling, the most critical pieces of information I want on the screen include: speed; distance to next turn; direction of turn; ETA",direction
"If you want current speed while on a route, you must touch the ETA info to take you to Garmin's trip info screen -- a very nice screen with cool information including: distance traveled since last reset; max speed; current speed; overall avg speed; moving avg speed; total time; total time moving; total time stopped; and direction of travel",direction
Wife and I got pretty good laughs at the directional abilities of this unit,direction
The Nuvi suggested other roads/direction that did not make any sense,direction
When I ignored the Nuvi's direction and kept driving on the HW80 west the Nuvi was unable to recalculate the current position(on HW80) to Michigan instead it suggested to turn around,direction
"It also would sometimes drive me insane with direction that I absolutely knew were wrong, like making me get off a freeway and then get right back on a few feet later",direction
"In general, it did its job, nearly 90% of the time giving us correct direction and getting us around old towns",direction
"So, that part was a bit frustrated, but we had maps to compare where we were going, and the GPS unit picked up new direction later and followed us through",direction
"(2) Four of the ""letter keys"" used for spelling were so sensitive AND INACCURATE AND UNRELIABLE that words had to be re-entered so often that it became easier to simply refer to a printed atlas for direction",direction
the 1390t always gave precise direction without causing confusion,direction
The turn-by-turn direction are very good,direction
"-Once I was following its direction (without looking at the screen) and as I arrived at my destination I realized it had directed me to ""1""--that's it--that was the complete address it had sent me to which happened to be a parking lot on the side of the highway about one mile from my actual destination",direction
That being said the main purpose of getting the device was its directional capabilities,direction
It took me less than five minutes from opening the package to being able to start getting direction,direction
"The direction given by the Garmin may have been shorter in total distance but may not have been the best, or most efficient route to take",direction
"4) It told me to go a direction that I knew, from years of experince, was not optimal, so I went my own way, and it said ""Recalculating""",direction
"But for now, there are times when I need direction and I don't know a good way to go",direction
"If you just want direction, stick with the simple units until the higher priced ones come down",direction
"Before I bought it, I read all the reviews, looked up all other GPS systems and decided, that being directionally challenged, I needed one to tell me not just where to turn but what street I'm turning into",direction
"Tomtom is good and some even have voice and street turn direction, as well, but it might cost more",direction
"We charge it by the computer, which seems to work but then it dies when we are relying on it for turn by turn direction in an unfamliar city",direction
The screen could be bigger and the direction to how to use the GPS is  very limited,direction
I like the slim footprint which does allow for easier portability but when it comes to the actual gps' functionality it's definitely lacking when compared to the 765T that I was using (seems I'll have to go back to) which gives way better direction,direction
The turn-by-turn direction are LOUD and clear Cons: - glitchy touchscreen,direction
"I ignored the direction to follow the route I knew, and it took forever for the unit to ""recalculate"" and give me the correct direction",direction
"Positives: - Great compact size - Attractive - Easy to view - Fairly easy controls - Voice direction - Portability Negatives: - Have to flip up antenna every time - Maps are outdated from the beginning - Many businesses not registered in database - Quite a few addresses not registered in database - No ability to go to cross street or vicinities, have to input exact address and it has to be registered in their database - No ability to avoid toll roads - Have to input state, spell out city, etc",direction
"I wouldn't buy this or any other Garmin product again, and after the NY trip, we will always print out a hard copy of direction from GoogleMaps -- kind of makes the thing pointless, doesn't it? [buy, print, makes, does] [other, hard, pointless]
",direction
Other direction have been marginal,direction
"I've also had, on more occasions than i should have, where I had to exit out of the map area and re-enter the address because the gps sends me in the wrong direction, sometimes aimlessly it seems",direction
"I am rather good in direction myself but my wife has a problem with orientation, and she dreamt about the GSP",direction
"However, she has driven with this device and decided that for any new trip she, as before, needs to study a map and to ask for direction in advance rather than to rely on this imperfect instrument",direction
"Navigating in pedestrian mode was generally difficult: device accuracy was poor in densely built  urban streets so you couldn't always easily find what you were looking for, and there was no automatic rerouting if you made a wrong turn, so you had to struggle to figure out where you were and in which direction you had to move",direction
The direction provided by the Nuvi were the longest most round about diversion you could possibly come up with,direction
Verbal direction for street turns is a great feature,direction
"Downloaded maps shortly after I received it in hopes it would be accurate, again no very updated with direction",direction
"A little hard to read in direct sunlight but that is to be expected -When I could get a signal, the unit worked admirably well for providing direction and such",direction
"Overall Tomtom is a more intelligent machine that gives you intelligent direction - whereas the Garmin treats you like an autistic child, where you are left to rely mostly on the display pictures, and have no choice in where you are going",direction
"When you ignored those direction, it persists by asking to take couple of next exists or make U-turn",direction
"When I am on my street it is telling me to execute a U turn away from my house, so I can approach it from the other direction",direction
"Pro: a map doesn't play mp3 Con: in order to play mp3 now you need to take a GPS and a map To use the thing, you need to know the route first, at least the rough direction",direction
"When the unit is functioning properly, it gave me correct turning direction while closed up in the center console of my truck",direction
"When I go past a turn, or chose a different direction than recommended it assumes I know what I am doing and re-routs around the road I avoided",direction
) I usually assume that I am doing something wrong and need a nudge in the right direction,direction
(not a big deal) - Wind noise from window down or music/radio playing - hard to near impossible to hear the voice prompts and turn direction,direction
"Now I was able to ignore the route and drive a more conventional route and the 350 would note the change and update it's route and direction (but at first it will try to backtrack you, if your going to ignore the route and leave the unit on - you need to know where you are)",direction
You usually are past the recommended turn by the time the new direction come (at least that was true in Atlanta),direction
"If your only requirement for a GPS system is that you enter in an address and then get direction, then this unit will work for you",direction
"- Garmin keeps those areas a secret - If it does work for you, updating your maps can delete junction view Thus if junction view works in your area, you are lucky (and don't update your maps if you want to keep them) If junction view does not work in your area, you need to: - search the Garmin help files, find the write junction view file for your unit, - follow direction to save them on your desktop",direction
"- You will NOT use the map installer program to install the map files, - Instead follow the direction to mount the GPS as a drive and manually insert files into correct location for your unit - Note that the above just puts the files on your GPSr, junction view may not display in your area",direction
If we'd been in strange city/state (like we usually use our GPS) we'd still be lost or worse (visions of National Lampoons Vaction as Chevy pulls off the highway and asks for direction,direction
Good thing we ALWAYS take a print backup copy of direction just in case,direction
It then started to try to give the direction from our house rather than the current location,direction
Since the route was pretty easy we were able to follow the direction,direction
"I have to revert back to my old ways of calling for direction, or looking them up online",direction
"If direction are a priority, go with Tom-Tom -Rebooting - on several trips, the GPS would just reboot for no obvious reason",direction
"I was walking back to the car (having guessed the wrong exit) when a passing Good Samaritian stopped his car to help us, had us follow him for miles thru a series of twists and turns, then pointed us in the right direction as he turned off onto his own route",direction
Had it not been for this stroke of mercy we would have been going extra nightmare hours in the wrong direction,direction
It takes at least 5 minutes to find satellites to guide you in the right direction from the time you turn it on,direction
"PROS: - Voice recognition works surprisingly well - Fairly fast with finding a new route - Nice voice, easy to understand - Loud and clear with easy volume control - Love the lane-by-lane detailed views - Good timing with the navigation direction",direction
"I've decided to take friends' advice and ALWAYS punch out google direction before I leave, and not to rely solely on the Garmin nuvi! ['ve, decided, take, punch, leave, rely] [google]
",direction
But I am not very happy with the distorted sound when it is giving me direction,direction
"I wish the thing was more accurate and gave direction earlier, many times my exit is almost up and gone when the system is still counting down the distance to the ramp, best to hit the list function and browse your route before getting off highway",direction
The main reason I got this is I am directionally challenged and always getting lost,direction
"""  I would give it a C- in terms of direction; an A in terms of start-up time, graphics (including lane assist), and sound",direction
"From that point on, the direction were accurate",direction
"I used it last night, without it turning it off, but the accuracy of the direction, on a scale of 1-10, was a 1 (one)",direction
Second - The direction the GPS tells you to go do not tell you the closest off ramp at times,direction
"When direction were spoken, the voice was extremely muffled and difficult to hear",direction
"- Garmin keeps those areas a secret - If it does work for you, updating your maps can delete junction view Thus if junction view works in your area, you are lucky (and don't update your maps if you want to keep them) If junction view does not work in your area, you need to: - search the Garmin help files, find the write junction view file for your unit, - follow direction to save them on your desktop",direction
"- You will NOT use the map installer program to install the map files, - Instead follow the direction to mount the GPS as a drive and manually insert files into correct location for your unit - Note that the above just puts the files on your GPSr, junction view may not display in your area",direction
Device works as advertised with good direction etc,direction
It seemed like it would go out just when I was getting close to my destination and needed the detailed direction,direction
The commands are clear and so far we have not encountered any misdirection,direction
Then the speaker died which makes the device much less useful since it is dangerous to try to read a small screen for direction while navigating through heavy traffic,direction
"Again, I use GPS for work, and you you want to get off a highway exit and make a u-turn, then get back on and go the same direction again, this is for you! [use, want, get, make, get, go, is] [u-turn, same]
",direction
It does not give you the best direction,direction
i looked at my route before i got started because i know which direction i want to go but dont know how to follow through,direction
"The pros: the direction are clear and timely, lane assist is helpful, estimated arrival time accurate",direction
One other feature that I find extremely annoying is that it always points the direction in which you are going up,direction
"I would prefer to see it as a normal map, with north always being up and south down, and the travel direction changing",direction
"I bought this item because I am terrible at direction, especially at night",direction
"One reviewer complained that this unit doesn't include a compass, but in reality, through the ""Tools"" selection, you can choose the detailed map option and get not only direction of travel, but elevation, vehicle speed and time data displayed",direction
"If you start steering in your preferred direction, n&uuml;vi will re-calculate, but occasionally try to get you to an interstate",direction
"Also, when you pull into a parking lot, n&uuml;vi seems to get ""lost"" and informs you that you're driving on an alley, or driving on the nearest street -- or just driving in a particular direction",direction
"the unit opted to take me off the interstate and going in a different direction? [opted, take, going] [different]
",direction
"In Boston, I notice it takes me one direction (the quickest way, straight from the highway) to the airport and brings me back another, through pothole ravaged streets in neighborhoods I REALLY don't want to be in",direction
"The interesting thing is she has no trouble telling me where I am on these country roads and I was able to ""unlose"" myself on the way to Romney by canceling the direction and just looking at the map and ""swishing"" the map around following different roads until I could see where I should go",direction
To get quick direction and reliable reception,direction
This one loses reception while passing under a small two lane overbridge and also takes forever to calculate the distances and get direction,direction
It would also be cool to hear the voice interrupt my radio so that I could listen to music and then hear the GPS direction as they are spoken,direction
It gives correct and accurate direction every single time,direction
Another time I was told to turn left into a parking lot and once that happened I was stuck in an endless loop of mis-direction by the Garmin,direction
"My issues: the voice quality on this GPS was poor, the audio cuts off mid sentence when providing direction, the map refresh rate is poor, with frequent freezing between screens, the touchscreen was not very sensitive in a specific area on the touchscreen, and the display sometimes spins way off axis when I am on an exit ramp",direction
When using a GPS I rely on the spoken direction at least as much as I rely on what is going on the display,direction
I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 350 because I have a very bad sense of direction and could get lost going around the block,direction
I developed a new-found sense of confidence and was looking forward to exploring the area after my relocation without having to try and read maps or direction while driving,direction
"I foolishly depended on this unit to get me to a job interview  during rush hour, in the rain, without a back-up set of direction or a map",direction
"Since I did not have a map with me, I finally got frustrated and had to stop in a convenience store and ask for direction",direction
The interface and vocal direction given are great,direction
"Unfortunately for my sister-in-law, we lost her, because her Garmin, which gave her the same direction that our Garmin gave us, made her go through Manhattan",direction
This certainly didn't make me feel confident in the device especially if you are driving in areas where you need direction,direction
"For those of us that use this device for commutes, and in well known areas I think the makers need to realize that we aren't using this device for turn by turn direction as much as just a traffic advisory device",direction
"They don't have this unit on hand to work with, and they are using support direction for other units which don't have the same menu's as the 295W",direction
"To just make sure I wasn't missing something, I programed the Nuvi to avoid all routes except Toll Roads and asked it for my direction",direction
The voice direction were clear and accurate and gave you plenty of time to anticipate your turns (the route still stunk),direction
"TomTom lets me show time needed to destination, miles left, arrival time, direction of travel all on the same screen",direction
"Last week, I was driving in a strange area and trying to follow the direction to get on the highway and nuvi-1300 suddenly stopped giving any instructions",direction
"It completely missed one place I was trying to go, and if I was depending on it for direction to a business meeting I would be in real trouble",direction
It's a good product if you have a set of backup direction,direction
"For me though, if I need backup direction why have the nav device? [need, have] [backup]
",direction
"My old, outdate nuvi gives me better direction",direction
All I cared about was having the basic turn-by-turn direction,direction
"Unfortunately, when starting it up, I find the maps load a bit slow and and as I'm driving, the voice gives one direction while the display is showing the opposite, e",direction
"I can listen to books with headphones but as far as listening to ""Jill"" give direction, no more",direction
"Often it did not give me the anticipatory direction, like ""turn right at blah-blah, and then turn right",direction
The only way we knew we where ok was the direction to go to the nreext point,direction
I've tried all of the direction I found online (because the books were useless) about moving far away from any buildings and going outside,direction
For the first half of the trip the direction were spot on,direction
"Twice the direction told us to get off of the highway and brought us through local neighborhoods for a few blocks and then led us right back onto the highway we just got off of! [told, get, brought, led, got] [local, few]
",direction
"Everything about the unit works great, it is easy to use, I love how it talks to you, easy direction, etc",direction
This Garmin Nuvi 350 is great and useful for travelling in the city you really have no idea about the direction,direction
Other direction are equally as convoluted,direction
The good news is I had printed out mapquest direction,direction
The voice feature has loud and clear direction,direction
"While I like the large screen and visual ease of this unit, I take exception with the direction I receive from the ""Garmin Lady",direction
It is helpful to Mapquest your route before going someplace unknown as I simply don't trust this unit's direction,direction
The direction and distance of an attempted scrolling action has little relationship to the way the display moves,direction
The maps themselves look beautiful and the map view in general is wonderfully customizable and direction are very clear and readable,direction
"It would be nice to have a ""route"" button or something that takes you directly to the direction since ease-of-use is helpful while driving",direction
"The Way Points transferred okay, but I had to rebuild the routes from the way points from within the Garmin but the direction the Garmin calculated were different from what was shown on the computer",direction
"On a trip to a nearby city, I wanted to find alternate routes to my destination, after it finally turned on, it wouldn't recalculate the route in time for me to make the necessary directional changes",direction
- Only 1 volume level for both direction and phone whereas the Garmin 2460LMT has separate volume levels,direction
"A few of the voices are quite clear, the timing of turn direction is good",direction
"I've contacted Garmin and am awaiting their reply, but in the mean time I'm back to printing out Mapquest direction",direction
"The voice is entertaining, especially when you go against the voice's direction",direction
The voice system continued to give direction but they were virtually useless without the screen to look at,direction
"4 of a mile, ""make a U-turn when possible"" to return in the direction that I could have gone in if I had just turned left out of the parking lot",direction
"Twice it gave me direction to drive down a one way street (The Wrong Way! [gave, drive] [Wrong]
",direction
The most annoying feature is that the mapping direction are only correct about 95% of the time,direction
I found that it was necessary to confirm direction with a conventional map in order to avoid those occasional mis-direction,direction
"On the positive side, it is much easier to listen to the direction than reading a map while driving",direction
I found British Emily on my 660 to have the most respectful voice when giving direction,direction
The voice command works very well and is useful for hands free direction finding,direction
"The ""voice"" includes street names in directional instructions",direction
If I compare driving direction from computer and GPS this is not the same and looks less suitable,direction
"The spoken direction are certainly less stressful than three years ago and there is now an automatic recalculation feature which, while annoyingly obtrusive, makes the device more useful",direction
"Pros: Big screen, loud adjustable voice, easy to use, cool features like Point Of Interest and language options, readable color coding for direction Cons: Touch screen is slow to respond or doesn't respond at all at times I'm sad I had to return this product because I loved the pros, but the ONE con was enough to annoy me to the point of returning it",direction
"I previously had a Garmin nuvi 350 that sometimes gave good direction and sometimes very incorrect routes, despite map 'upgrades'",direction
"While it has been ok overall (we only use it for direction, not for music and all the other stuff it can do) We have always had the following issues: 1",direction
"On a recent trip, this happened, and thank god I had memorized the direction, otherwise it would have been a scramble to call and get direction the old fashioned way",direction
"The pros are that maps/driving direction are more user-friendly, in the way that it'll forewarn you to merge into the appropriate lane, or show you the split in roads (as in the photo) - which will save you lots of time in avoiding turn-arounds or having to take a less-direct route",direction
"and lots of gas) Strike 3 - Second trip driving around DC it got lost and took me right downtown next to the National Mall (I know there it a lot of construction but the maps are supposed to be updated quarterly) After several wrong turns, I found my own way back the direction I needed to go",direction
"I have a need for something that gives clear-voiced, efficient direction, and provides a readable screen in sunlight",direction
I just wanted something to read clear-voiced efficient direction to me while I'm driving,direction
Second direction is useless because there is no compass in the unit,direction
Also when you are moving the unit does not reflect your movement and you can not understand are you moving in correct direction or not,direction
My 350 would typically have direction ready for most addresses within 10-15 seconds,direction
However the thing that's a deal-breaker for me (and that dropped my rating so low) is the quality of the audio for the spoken direction,direction
"While driving, I don't want to have to take my eyes off the road to see where the next turn is, I listen for the spoken direction",direction
"Sorry, but unless spoken direction aren't as important to you as they are to me, I would look at another Garmin model",direction
"Sometimes the spoken direction are opposite of the actual map direction, leading to confusion and maybe accident",direction
"Mio has a cockpit view that shows your speed and the next turn direction, where as nuvi there is no cockpit view",direction
The Garmin did show after pushing a few prompts what the exact direction were,direction
"Garmin doesn't want you to enter navigation direction while you drive (it's dangerous! [does, want, enter, drive, 's] [dangerous]
",direction
"The voices on the spoken direction are sometimes unintelligible, with ludicrous mispronunciations",direction
"Traffic reports tell us about slowdowns on different highways from the ones we're on, tens of miles away, not in our direction of travel, and are available only for metropolitan areas",direction
It also tells you the right direction to turn,direction
"The routing algorithm is adequate, but not as accurate as my old GPS V for finding fastest route - especially if the first leg of the route is not in the straight line direction to the destination",direction
"If we don't follow ""her"" route, she says ""re-calculating"" and almost sounds P*%^ed off that we didn't follow her direction",direction
"OK so it didn't think I could make the ramp, fair enough, but when I did enter the freeway it still thought I was on the frontage road and calculated direction based on that fact",direction
"If so, they are making a huge marketing mistake - should a service like Bing or Google decide to add a subscription talking directional application, both firms would find their product obsolete in short order",direction
"It is also mixing up its left and right direction (which occurred in the late stages of my old Nuvi, and I chalked up to wear/tear, but no excuse for this relatively new unit)",direction
"Every once in a while, the unit would plot a course, and then NOT re-calculate when we missed a turn, or took off in a different direction",direction
"Using GPS and the VZW network, you can get maps, get driving direction (complete with audible turn-by-turn direction and text-to-speech (I",direction
"Garmin has been great so far, however, the product came with many useless  software which I don't need, and it does not give direction quickly; by the time the navigator has recalculated a new route, I've passed the exit or street it was talking about",direction
"This is great for those people with poor sense of direction, because it gives you an idea of where you are, but would I travel to some unknown part of the US with this thing, NO",direction
"Almost took me abt 10 miles off my course (I just happend to have an old printout of direction in the glovebox) It was not cloudy, however the home is by the beach, so there was some heavy misting",direction
"Now this was a new road and so I was not surprised, However when i drove back, All three round abouts had registered on the GPS, and it now gave me appropriate direction based on that particualr roundabouts",direction
"In the vast majority of cases, it has given very accurate direction on how to arrive at a destination I've never been to before",direction
"Unless it's because I have an older model and the maps aren't updated, the direction to my house and the highway are not accurate",direction
"I don't fully trust the nav and I still google the direction and that was the whole point of buying a nav! [do, trust, google, was, buying] [whole]
",direction
GPS extrapolates last position and current speed and direction with the accelerometer,direction
In operation it works quite well with quick response to changes in direction,direction
"I drive for business, I cannot have a GPS that will continually try and get you to go onto surface streets, or, go through so many streets around the obvious direction",direction
"Rather, it keeps you headed in the direction your going in (wrong direction) with a transparent lane",direction
"- Garmin keeps those areas a secret - If it does work for you, updating your maps can delete junction view Thus if junction view works in your area, you are lucky (and don't update your maps if you want to keep them) If junction view does not work in your area, you need to: - search the Garmin help files, find the write junction view file for your unit, - follow direction to save them on your desktop",direction
"- You will NOT use the map installer program to install the map files, - Instead follow the direction to mount the GPS as a drive and manually insert files into correct location for your unit - Note that the above just puts the files on your GPSr, junction view may not display in your area",direction
"I actually plan on zapping the audible direction completely as they are a bit irritating, particularly when turns are closely grouped",direction
"The spoken direction were very clear, and plenty loud",direction
I have had Nuvi 1300 less than 3 months and now it gives me a blank screen when it trys to render direction,direction
"It's slimmer, the map displays are more versatile and sophisticated, vocal direction are louder, it has Bluetooth, it's more responsive to voice command, and you don't need a button to activate voice command",direction
"The wide 5'' screen is a plus, and the direction are easy to follow",direction
"First day we were using it, it started to recalculate our route all of a sudden, even though we had not failed following its direction! [were, using, started, recalculate, had, failed, following] [First, sudden]
",direction
It spits out a drunken man's direction to  point B from A and tells you to visit A1,direction
"Those features are great, but the reason to buy an GPS system is for its routing/direction capabilities",direction
It was being compared side-by-side with our Garmin 260W which gave correct direction at all times,direction
I found a slim little pamphlet with the most abbreviated direction I've ever seen,direction
We discovered that the commands were frequently too sudden and eventually the Garmin lagged at least a mile with its driving direction,direction
"I asked it to take me to  the closest Home Depot, and it happily gave me direction to an empty lot",direction
"First it took me off the main street where I was traveling and looped me around in a residential area, then led me back exactly to where it'd turned me off, and had me continue the same direction I'd been going! [took, was, traveling, looped, led, turned, had, continue, been, going] [main, residential, same]
",direction
I bought it especially because it has verbal direction for all the streets-driving and turning,direction
"This goes for searching destinations, but also overall handling and even talking direction",direction
"I have to start over by going back to ""recent locations"" and selecting the address before the system sends me in the right direction",direction
70 DAYS after purchase and using it one time the speaker started cutting in and out so bad he couldn't understand the direction he was hearing,direction
"I don't have a good sense of direction, and friends who own this device have touted its usefulness, as have myriad reviewers",direction
"Though this is a sleek-looking little device, that seems insufficient to recommend it, especially for a task as essential as driving direction",direction
*sigh*  At least it work correctly on the motorcycle and give me direction in my Bluetooth headset,direction
"City to city direction, however, were in my opinion a bit questionable",direction
"The screen is very easy to read, spoken direction including street names were excellent",direction
"You only need the unit to do ONE thing, and that is to provide reliable, easy-to-understand direction",direction
I make you real confious if you listen it its direction,direction
"It gives wrong street names about 10% of the time in my Central Texas city of 50,000 and gives direction after the fact when exiting a garage or an address",direction
If this is the direction that Garmin products are going then I think my next GPS will be a Tom Tom,direction
The Magellan gave better direction while the Garmin seemed to have taken us the long way around,direction
"
",direction
"I really wanted the larger screen, traffic, and lane assist that the 1450 offered",screen
"3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator</a> This GPS, ordered in May for $449, was delayed and defective when finally delivered in July",screen
"I live in Northern Virginia and the reason of why i bought this GPS were for both screen size and traffic, the traffic in this area is very heavy in the morning and in the afterrnoon",screen
"7- Talking to my wife using the bluetooth, she couldn't hear me very well, eventhough i could heard her very loud Pros: 1-Big screen 2-Free traffic 3-Refreshing time is very fast 4-After the first time, it aquires satellite signal fairly fast 5-Speake is very loud Bottom line is not worth the price, you are better off with the Nuvi 265WT for 199",screen
"99 or less, it has the same features with a smaller screen I would not recommend it to a friend",screen
"The 3790T has the best screen viewing, average POI (built-in) searches (minus any Google, weather, or fuel price searches, or Caio! [has] [best, average]
",screen
The other thing it would do is change screens to a setting function,screen
#NAME?,screen
Either the screen could be larger or an option for larger font,screen
"Sure, there are visual informantion on the screen, but most drivers use audio cues instead on visual cues when driving to pay attention to congested traffic",screen
The more important issue that just struck me is popup ads on the screen,screen
To whit: -  The screen takes many seconds to display,screen
"So often when approaching a complex intersection, just when I need it most, it goes blank trying to re-write the screen",screen
"Also, whenever I do touch the screen, it places a point in ""recently found"", so the recently found list is full of crap points, rather than the real points I have found, making ""recently found"" useless",screen
"Also, hitting ""backup"" or other points on the touchscreen may or may not actually do anything; tho this may just be the very very slow response of this unit",screen
"Again, all on your map screen and it looks really nice",screen
"Purchased for lifetime traffic and maps, unit has nice features, exceptional screen, but unfortunaelly compared to my last two Tom-Tom's the directions are inferior, crazy routes, wrong turns, incorrect street names, a significant difference, enough so that I am going back to a Tom-Tom",screen
The screen is much brighter; the size is thinner; the speaker on the back of the mounting device makes it much easier to hear while speaking on the bluetooth (though it is still sometimes difficult to make out what people are saying with the road noise),screen
"Pluses for the 3790LMT are better and bigger screen, smaller depth (think I-phone), better battery life, glass screen (easy to clean), good satellite pick up speed and more fully featured",screen
"Minuses are: limited traffic availability on this type of system, difficulties switching between screens (limited shortcut buttons), poor sound quality, extremely limited voice choices (as compared to Magellan), extremely limited icon choices (as compared to Magellan), awkward and unclear on-line updates and support information, and loss of traffic feature if not on power cord",screen
"Let's go to the positives about this device: - very clear display under all light conditions - great user interface - screens shows a preview of highway signs and which lanes to be on (real nice feature) - has built-in battery, so works without always being plugged in - free traffic updates (though it forces you to see ads on the screen) Now onto the negatives, which are so bad that I wish I could return this, but only came to figure them out after an extended period using it: - First and foremost, this product is CRAP when calculating the best routes for long distance trips",screen
"I like the larger screen, the Bluetooth, the quick satellite lock, and other features, but",screen
"It was nice to view when it flashed on the screen and accurately depicted the intersection, BUT, it only stayed on the screen a few seconds then went off, never to reappear again",screen
"I got this for Christmas and while I like the bigger screen, I don't like the ads that pop up",screen
"3 inch screen, but they usually cost around $50 more",screen
"If you follow my advice and get a unit with text to speech, you will NEVER need to look at the unit while driving, so the screen size is really a non-issue",screen
"Apparently about three years ago, a batch of defective touch-screens were incorporated in this model",screen
On re-start it flashed to the Garmin splash screen and constantly re-booted,screen
"On one hand it's got a bright easy to see in any light screen, and the built in picture viewer and MP3 player are cool (even though I NEVER use them), but on the other hand this thing can really suck at choosing routes! ['s, got, see, built, are, NEVER, use, suck, choosing] [bright, easy, light, MP3, cool, other]
",screen
It gave the name of the highway rather than the name of the street to exit and had the correct street name in () marks on the screen,screen
"For example, you can scroll the map by sliding your finger on the screen -- but most of the time (though not always; why? [scroll, sliding] [most]
",screen
"Responsive touch-screen, big size makes selections easy",screen
Panning/browsing screen almost impossible (see rubber-band effect) due to software bugs,screen
Moving the screen by fingertip is not so good though,screen
Big screen is beautiful,screen
Bad: - battery life: is too short (less than 3hrs) even with screen turned off to conserve,screen
I took some screenshots of my setup and opened an email support ticket with Garmin  technical support,screen
Replied back and got a response from a 3rd tech but wanting a description of the problem which I had so painstakingly described with screenshots and descriptions in my initial inquiry,screen
I love some of the new navigation features (such as the multipoint routing) and the large screen but I purchased this unit primarily for its transit feature,screen
"Perhaps when Garmin resolves their software issues, I'll reconsider these new widescreen 1200/1300/1400 models but most likely not now",screen
"Although it has a nice big screen and shows the roads and intersections in detail, I have missed turns or took the wrong road on three different occasions, because the stated directions do not seem to keep up with my car location",screen
"from what i did see of the actual gps function (directions, maps, etc) this unit would be great if the screen worked properly",screen
bottom line: i would have recommended this gps to others if the screen worked - especially because it has walking directions which i thought was a really nice addition,screen
"Then, if you're in traffic, you have to go out of nav, through two other screens to change the option of shortest route",screen
"The ""fatal flaw"" for this unit is that in the middle of a 600 mile trip, it just went black and wouldn't turn on (tried the 3 suggestions: hold the power button down, hold the power button down while pressing bottom right of screen, plug into computer--these are nowhere in the manual, BTW! [is, went, turn, tried, hold, hold, pressing, are] [fatal, black, bottom]
",screen
The one thing that I must give to the Roadmates are that they are much more accurate than the Nuvi and the screen displays much more information than the Nuvi,screen
#NAME?,screen
"5"" screen, keyboard was ""ABC"" layout and difficult to type",screen
"5 inch Screen - to me, caring the unit is more important than 5"" screen, so I feel this is enough",screen
"As stated by other reviewers, however, it puts ads on the screen",screen
I barely started using it (took it out for 3 drives) when it started displaying a white screen which it just would not get out of,screen
"Even with selecting the ""Most"" map detail option, street names and other data is sparse especially on such a large a readable screen",screen
On the plus side as mentioned the large screen is very clear and visible and the touchpad is good enough preferring my finger nail to my finger,screen
In the meantime I just gaze at that beautiful screen,screen
The touch screen is a good size and durable,screen
"Also, while the big screen is nice, it's not quite bright enough to be clearly visible in really bright light",screen
The unit charged back up fine but when I tried to boot it up a message showed up telling me to press a dot that was on the screen,screen
DISLIKES- Advertisements on screen when not moving: Traffic delays not always accurate: Maps not always accurate,screen
This one has a ton of features and the screen looks great,screen
Names of roads are shown only in closest screens,screen
"Screen display: The Garmin has a nice, non-reflective, matt plastic screen, and the screen sensitivity is about right",screen
The Tomtom has a reflective glass screen and I found and a screen protector really helped,screen
"For my money it's also way too sensitive - I think your finger should to be able to find its way around the screen by touch before pressing the point you want, so you don't have to take your eye off the road",screen
"Unit #2: Had the same issues regarding registration, continual ""update available"" and the license agreement screen",screen
"This only made things worse: now every time I turned it on it prompted for the following: language, location, license, and the mandatory ""I understand the risks of using this device"" screen",screen
"This finally corrected all of the start-up screen prompts (only had to answer them once after the update)! [corrected, prompts, had, answer, update] [start-up]
",screen
"So bad, that I thought that maybe that feature was not active on my device, but after re-reading the product description and carefully looking through the Garmin screens, the traffic feature is in fact ""working"" on my Garmin",screen
"I have the setting ""Faster Times"" and avoidances ""Traffic"" selected, and the Garmin does show me if sections of my route are slow (with the colors yellow and read on the screen)",screen
"I bought this nuvi to always have something fired up and ready to go in my car, with a larger screen and maybe sharper features",screen
"But here's the deal:  When I forgot the spoken direction, I could not understand what I was to do next by simply looking at the screen",screen
A black and white arrow is not eay to see on a screen with a white background,screen
Smaller is not good when you are driving and navigating and you have to read the screen because you forgot the last command,screen
"However, after a little over a month, I am having problems with the unit, sometimes it just won't talk, forcing me to look at the Nuvi screen constantly so I won't miss my exit, not good if the traffic is heavy",screen
"I don't mind the smaller screen, but I don't like the flip up antennae",screen
The only way to verify the current version is to go into a deeply-embedded screen to match up the software version on your device,screen
They never responded and I have not checked for an update lately im use to it now and planning on a larger screen model,screen
"On the plus side, the screen is big and the typing is very easy",screen
This nuvi 1490T is my third GPS and I love the larger screen,screen
"Its not accurate when it tells  me where to make a turn with the voice, you better watch for the highlighted road in the screen",screen
"After attempting to update the software and map data, the unit went into an endless boot-up cycle (Garmin screen, map data loading, power down, power up, and repeat",screen
"Sometimes I have to keep my finger on a particular ""button"" for a few seconds for the screen to ""accept"" or recognize it",screen
Other times it will randomly just go to a screen I have not selected,screen
"The PROS for the 3790lmt is got to be it's abundant features -Bright screen and nice, crisp resolution -Voice command works really well -Life time map update and traffic alert but comes at a really high price -3-D view works in my area and it does show accurate outline of certain buildings and structures -Traffic light and speed cameras alert does work -Speed limit indicator is helpful and accurate majority of the time -Slimmest amongst its kind for excellent portability",screen
But it looks like a screen with much smaller resolution with everything so big,screen
Nowhere in the users manual mentioned this and nothing on screen telling users about the reduce volume,screen
Pros: -- Great screen: the display is plenty large & bright to see easily Cons: -- Utterly unreliable in acquiring satellite signals,screen
"So I put my finger on the screen, wait for a second, then slowly move it in the desired direction",screen
"With this more advanced and sophisticated unit I have to back out through all the address screens, go to View Map mode, zoom out of Texas, find Hawaii, zoom on Maui, find that location manually, and then I can set it as my new destination",screen
"20, and noticed it shows a split screen of map/visual on exit, as opposed to visual only, which is quite nice",screen
The screen would sometimes show the left third on the right side of the screen for about 10 seconds,screen
"*LARGE DISPLAY:  This 5"" screen on the nuvi 1450 is the smallest that I would want to work with",screen
Trying to hit the on-screen buttons at arm's length can be tricky,screen
"I will say that I think that the only significant flaw in this device is in how the unit handles the touch-screen, but this problem is so significant as to make the device practically unusable",screen
"That is, the on-screen key that I'm tying to press will eventually turn blue to indicate that the unit recognizes the input",screen
"Besides  that if you have you phone connected by the bluetooth, you can't make calls dialing right from the main map screen",screen
"Again, I'm comparing this to the 360, I can do these things with the 360 even though it's a much smaller screen! ['m, comparing, do, 's] [smaller]
",screen
Also looked forward to a bigger screen and access to more info,screen
"This is useful in finding a street at night(say when you're going to unfamiliar territory in your own town) The unit is pretty big, easy to see and the touch screen is great",screen
"When you use the traffic feature, pop-up ads continually appear on the screen",screen
"First off, as soon as I got the GPS I was let down by the size of the screen as I was expecting a screen size similar to my old Nuvi 650 4",screen
"3"" screen is definitely smaller",screen
"The voice is very audible in my right ear, but of course I can't see or touch the screen when it is in this position",screen
It wouldn't respond to either the on/off switch or the touchscreen,screen
"Unless you have memorized the manual and explored all the screens, including undocumented features, and use the unit every day, you will not be able to figure out how to get to various things you want to access because there is nothing on the screen to tell you how to do it",screen
The only viable difference between the two models is a slightly larger screen,screen
"Pro's: Size is nice, and the touch screen seems to be behaving better than previous models the features are a nice upgrade from the less expensive Garmin's I have had in the past shipped quickly (but I am a prime member) I have been sorely disappointed with this product",screen
"One more thing - it has constant ""rewards offers"" that pop up on screen for Best Western hotels, etc",screen
WiFi is about like a smartphone with the same size screen,screen
"turned out to be the same garmin nuvi but a 5 inch screen, that worked flawlessly",screen
"If you have to change the volume, you have to go back to main screen, exiting your   current itinerary than coming back to it, all done by toutching, taking your attention off the road for a   considerable amount of time, expecially in heavy traffic",screen
"A five-inch screen is great, but much of that is dedicated to feedback I don't care about (speed limit/altitude)",screen
"I have not tried 'eco route' related functionality I have updated map and software - so it has now latest firmware and map Basic functionality - add address/search address , navigation,interface is fine now i feel following issues - if anybody has any input let us know 1) when unit start - screen loads after ""I agree"" button ,it always make noise like ""spark "" or radio tunning for fraction of second and then it become normal",screen
this happens many times when u are on different screen in random manner i reduce the speaker volume to 50% or lower but i can hear it i am thinking to return this unit as later on this may develop in major issue,screen
"Kinda sad, I had my Abba songs on it and a picture of my Healey as the splash screen",screen
"the screen is good, voice and  color are also good",screen
Larger screen and improved graphics were impressive,screen
"Despite several restarts, it would not get past the loading maps screen",screen
I have had this unit for a while now and while overall I like the form factor and the screen,screen
I have two multi-touch devices (iPad and HTC Inspire cellphone) and both work beautifully in selecting and zooming on the screen,screen
"5"" non-touch screen) for over 6 years, I'm appalled at the ""simplification"" of today's newer GPS",screen
"I bought this unit--since returned due to a problem with it turning off and then on (sattellite coverage OK) several times in a 200 mile trip--as I liked the larger screen, and because there are no new map updates for the '276",screen
He agrees but he's getting older and is willing to give up some detail for the easier to read screen,screen
"Also, the touch screen is a neat feature, but is hard to control where you're touching while driving--then you get a different screen",screen
"The Garmin ""city-select"" maps or ""mapsource"" come with the software to allow a trip to be created on the large screen of one's computer and make necessary adjustments prior to down loading to the gps device--another feature I miss! [come, allow, be, created, make, loading, miss] [city-select, large, necessary]
",screen
"Love the larger screen, my only complaint [so far] is speed limit does not appear! [is, does, appear] [larger, only]
",screen
"My old Garmin didn't have these issues, I just wanted to upgrade to a new one with a larger screen and traffic, but not one that will lose me in my own backyard",screen
I like the large screen on this Garmin and the lane assist feature is definitely helpful in big cities,screen
"Compared to an iPhone, for instance, moving closer or farther from the location viewed is much more cumbersome than simply moving your fingers apart or together on a touchscreen",screen
"Beautiful screen, easy to use, but takes FOREVER to acquire satellites! [use, takes, acquire] [Beautiful, easy]
",screen
Digital buttons on the LCD screen are not sensitive enough and I find I have to push down kinda hard to get them to respond which makes inputting addresses tedious,screen
"when you go to the volume screen, it still says it is set at 70% (where i like it) and the mute box is not checked",screen
"The unit asks for the address to be entered & when I put in the street & number , the next screen asks for the number which I have already entered",screen
"I have tried the ""recalibrate screen"" multiple times, sometimes without even trying since the unit locks up all the time! [have, tried, trying, locks] [recalibrate, multiple]
",screen
"I will say this, the ads that people complain about: i don't see what the big deal is, they're tiny, they occasionally pop up & never interfere w/ the screen or directions",screen
"The Good: Pretty big screen, nice touch-screen controls, easy to use",screen
"The screen is large enough to easily read, the maps seem up-to-date",screen
"I spent almost two hours stumbling through various screens until the update was downloaded, I thought to my Garmin device",screen
"I cracked the right side of the screen trying to get the ""l"" to respond, and now I can only navigate to places that don't require the right side of the keyboard",screen
You have set the unit's screen at a slight downward angle and everything will be fine,screen
"However, if you want something 100% reliable all the time right now, I'd shop for a Garmin unit that has a good screen if it still exists",screen
On-screen buttons sometimes require two pushes to get my touch to register -- this typically happens when entering an address and it suggests several town names - I have to press twice sometimes to get it to accept the entry,screen
"On the other hand, the screen is bright and large, the sound quality is great, and ease of use is fantastic",screen
Also the POI's are fair and the Mio are much better and have the POI icons on the screen as you are driving,screen
"The Nuvi 1490LMT is well made and has a clear, bright screen that presents information in a good, simple and informative format",screen
"And that 5"" screen, that should be *very* easy to see! [be, see] [easy]
",screen
As an example: My one button operation to change the sound level on the TomTom sometimes takes so long to get to the change screen that it immediately flips back to the main screen before I can make a change so I have to hit the location of where the sound bar will be in advance of it appearing to get the sound right (presumably it starts timing how long it is on the volume change screen from the time you hit the button and not from when the screen appears),screen
Leading up to that section it clearly has in the upper left section of the screen a little graphic indicating the lane to be in too,screen
It also has clearly at the top of the screen what the next instruction will be,screen
TomTom has 2 sets of screen colors which it can automatically flip between - one set for night and the other for day,screen
"Garmin doesn't have this, though its screen isn't glossy like the TomTom's is and can be seen easier in sunlight I think",screen
"Turn information: Occasionally, I like to see what directions I will need to take ahead of time and with the Garmin it is an easy one screen push operation, with my TomTom I have to do about 3 or 4 button pushes to get to the right screen (though the TomTom does have more choices like seeing it in text, map images or through a moving driving demo going through the map as you would be whilst driving)",screen
Garmin has this way easier once you know where on the screen to push to get the information as it isn't spelled out,screen
"The newest iPhone (or iPod Touch with Wi-Fi) Google Pedestrian Maps completely works for approximately the same amount of money and a unit that is half the thickness, better touch screen, and this piece of junk simply does not work",screen
"It used to have one of the best screens out there, as you can read in many of the 2005 reviews",screen
"But that's changed, and the new screen is a downgraded high glare one",screen
"The navigation works great, and if you don't try to read the screen in sunlight you'll be fine",screen
"I don't think it's worth the high price - unless they return to the original, better screen",screen
"After registration and updates, there is a white dot line across the screen",screen
"It's 5"" screen is nice",screen
The screen is really impressive and everything works out of box,screen
"I really tried to keep it for this big and bright screen, but I couldn't bear it for the below reasons",screen
Alright it has a wonderful size screen and everything is nice and clear you have pretty good features and all,screen
"Second what is up with coupons popping up on the screen while your driving and trying to see where you are going? [is, popping, trying, see, are, going] [Second]

"why else did the screen flip upside down at one point? [did] [flip]
",screen
doesnt matter which +/- on screen that i push,screen
"3) The large screen, though not a necessity, is nice to have",screen
"If I had looked at the screen more closely, I may have been able to make the exit, but I was focused on the road more",screen
I'm not sure if TomTom has announced street names and as large a screen,screen
The Garmin has a much bigger screen and lifetime maps and text-to-speech and traffic alerts but the TomTom is such a pleasure to use compared to the Garmin,screen
* When entering addresses the Garmin will suddenly jump from a data-entry screen with a keyboard to a pick-list of choices once it has narrowed down the options enough based on what you've already typed,screen
If I'm typing along quickly the screen will often change to the pick-list right as I'm about to hit the next letter resulting in me inadvertently choosing the wrong street off the pick list,screen
* When the Garmin loses satellite reception (like when you're going through a tunnel) it pops up a big window over the screen announcing the fact that it lost reception,screen
"The TomTom just grays out the screen to indicate that it doesn't have reception but continues to plot your path at your last recorded speed, then gracefully picks up again when it regains a signal without distracting the user with a pointless button push",screen
So you end up wasting a lot of the space on that big screen anyway,screen
"For example, the ability to jump to any screen by voice (such as ""traffic"" or ""tools"" or ""settings"") is no longer available",screen
"Cons: There is way too little info on the screen with only two settings ""more"" or ""less""",screen
More eats up a quarter of screen running vertical instead of running horizontal like it does in less mode,screen
I had an old model but a few years back decided to upgrade to a new flat screen model so that I could more easily pack it for trips,screen
This model seemed too good to be true - flat screen and lifetime free map upgrades,screen
"The Picturesque Lane View feature is nice, but unless you are staring at it to catch it, you will probably miss it because it only stays on the screen for a couple of seconds and goes away long before you actually have to make your lane change, I was about to call Garmin to complain mine didn't have the feature because I kept missing it when it popped up",screen
"I love the larger screen, and I like the addition of the Speed Limit, as well as the ability to have a clock on the map screen",screen
"I replaced an older Garmin unit with this one and was, at first, very impressed with the features and screen functions",screen
"Took it for trips around the neighborhood, still won't go past the initial screen",screen
I tried pressing the dot at various points on the screen about 50 times but it just kept going,screen
Master reset won't work and it just keeps coming back to the same screen,screen
"It always screened ""No map data available"" for the two days trip<a href=""http://www",screen
"- again, related to the touchscreen: when I browse a map and want to select a place where I want to go to, the GPS does not 'feel' it all the time - when I browse a map, it takes a long time to download (much longer than my previous GPS)",screen
One main thing to remember is to make sure you uncheck most of the choices on the avoidance screen so your routing is more accurate,screen
I have my doubts about the long term durability of the pop-in connection between the GPS screen and the suction mount,screen
"The forums said this is to calibrate the touchscreen, but which touchscreen keeps asking ""press dot"" for more than 100 touches? [said, is, calibrate, keeps, asking, dot] [more]
",screen
#NAME?,screen
There's not much new aside from the digital compass and the speed limit readout in the lower right hand corner of the screen,screen
Its really annoying to keep looking at the screen to make sure you haven't missed your exit or whatnot,screen
"Overall, its a good GPS, just a few minor glitches that hopefully can be solved with a few push of buttons on the screen",screen
(5) No ability to display more than two data fields on the map screen at the same time,screen
The bottom right of the screen shows distance to next turn (but not what kind of turn it is),screen
"On all of their models you can define data fields to display on the map screen, including: speed, ETA, compass (with various options), distance remaining, etc",screen
"When I'm traveling, the most critical pieces of information I want on the screen include: speed; distance to next turn; direction of turn; ETA",screen
"Garmin gives me that, but only spread among multiple screens with no configurable option to see all at once",screen
"With Garmin, the best I got was: the map screen, including ETA, and distance to next turn",screen
"If you want current speed while on a route, you must touch the ETA info to take you to Garmin's trip info screen -- a very nice screen with cool information including: distance traveled since last reset; max speed; current speed; overall avg speed; moving avg speed; total time; total time moving; total time stopped; and direction of travel",screen
"These are all very nice pieces of information, but I also want to see the map (which you don't on this screen), AND more importantly, I STILL want to see how far until the next turn, and what that turn is",screen
I found myself compromising and selecting the screen that caused me the least pain for the duration,screen
"Cons: cannot configure ""view map"" screen to display what I think are critical information: current speed (while on a route -- not even an option); distance to next turn (including what type of turn that is); compass (while on a route -- not even an option); ETA; clock (not even an option); and distance remaining (not even an option)",screen
"All in all with its large screen, fast sat connection, free map updates the 1450 is a solid GPS",screen
"You can save yourself money and disappointment, get a basic large screen GPS Feb 2012 Had an occasion to use this unit out of my local area",screen
"3) The lane assist is very poor, consisting of a series of arrows at the top of the screen (not actually on the map itself) that causes you to look back and forth from arrows - map - arrows - etc to figure out which lane you should be in",screen
5)The screen brightness on the highest setting is much less than my old Garmin,screen
"The screen is less glossy than my old Garmin, but overall the screen is larger but harder to view in the daytime",screen
"I opened the box and was immediately impressed by the size of the screen and was looking foward to using it knowing that it had up to date maps, etc",screen
"The bigger screen allows for more information to be displayed, and one of the options includes elevation, which I was thrilled to see",screen
"At the end of the working day-around 5PM (and it is not summer now), I tried to enter the address on the on-screen keyboard and the right side of the keyboard was not initially working at all",screen
"It looks well built, has a nice appearance and the screen is great viewing but sometimes does not respond well to the touch",screen
Quit zooming my screen up and down to look sexy,screen
"Yes, the screen is bigger at 5-inches, but it is set at very low resolution",screen
The screen is just bigger and does not really show more information,screen
"I'm not going to repeat what so many other reviews here have said about the screen, mounting, and so on",screen
My friend uses a magellan (old non-widescreen 2-d version) on the same vehicle and her mount stays,screen
The screen is sensitive and responsive and everything else works fine,screen
"1) Unit was charged and I powered unit up 2) The Pwr sequence a bit slower compared to my Tom Tom 720 but more technology more power more delays 3) Unit goes into demo mode and sat in vechile for 15 minutes trying to get satellites to show up as recomended in quick start manual 4) I exited demo mode and proceeded to deactivate demo mode because unit was not seeing any Satellites 5) followed instruction but the unit will NOT recognize the request to deactivate GPS simulator mode, the unit acknowledged that you are pressing touch screen by making an audible sound but it does not change state 6) I found I curious that the unit was not sealed in original packaging?

Magellan's screen was much more responsive,screen
The Magellan's screen was bright and easy to see regardless of lighting conditions,screen
"however it does find satellite signals quickly, reroutes quickly, has lane assist which is great and has a very wide screen",screen
The defeact is a little green dot in my screen,screen
"It set-up easy, and I even liked the screen better",screen
"Another time while following the road, the screen showed me veering off-road and into a field for a mile before re-joining the highway",screen
"I love the big screen! [love] [big]

"-Once I was following its directions (without looking at the screen) and as I arrived at my destination I realized it had directed me to ""1""--that's it--that was the complete address it had sent me to which happened to be a parking lot on the side of the highway about one mile from my actual destination",screen
") -While travelling straight East on a major interstate it directed me to take an exit and get on another interstate that travels North-South, although the route lines on the screen stayed correct (travelling East",screen
"The new Garmin GPSes are slick and have nice menu options -- and at first, a seemingly better touch-screen sensitivity",screen
"In strong sunlight, the driver can barely make anything out on the screen, but then again, the driver should be looking at the road",screen
"The screen size on the unit was way, way, way too small to use the WIFI browser acceptably and it was just barely acceptable for GPS and map usage",screen
The next unit I buy will have a larger screen and no WIFI capability,screen
"Over 30 minutes of warning with decent estimates of miles/minutes delay   Lane assist, very helpful   As one with visual issues, the 5"" screen and increased font size were much more readable   Blue tooth worked well, very clear and usable CONS: Popup ads are annoying but not horrible   Too many options/extras (such as voices) must now be purchased",screen
"ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/1/11) After several years using (and satisfied with) the Garmin 260W I decided it was time to upgrade to a 5"" screen and lifetime map updates",screen
"Bottom Line: PROS:   As a longtime user of Garmin I found the user interface easy to use   Directions and routing were good, similar to my experiences with other GPS's   Blue tooth worked well with my cell phone   Large screen and some of the newer sw enhancements were nicely done   I personally like the 3D display better than that of the TomTom 550 CONS:   Deceptive description of mapping capabillities   Annoying popup ads on traffic mode   Support did not appear to know their products well   Website not much help in defining features/capabillities/usage in a meaningful way   Horribly confusing array of product numbers   5"" screen is nice but probably not worth extra expense Sadly I am still looking for a good GPS with bluetooth, larger screen, decent maps of N",screen
"Also you cant really see on the screen and see the roads coming, its confusing",screen
"*  The screen stays on continuously while charging via a computer USB port, which may reduce the life of the back-light (and device stays hot to the touch)",screen
"It's very compact, and the screen is also very clear",screen
"The touch screen works really well, and is responsive",screen
"Overall it's very good with a bigger screen, easier to navigate menu, and built-in traffic support",screen
"The rest of the Unit is acceptable, features, screen, time to locate a satellite are all OK",screen
The screen could be bigger and the directions to how to use the GPS is  very limited,screen
I was also disappointed by the slow response of the touch screen,screen

"3"" Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Map Updates & Traffic unit has the ANNOYING advertisements running across the top of screen whenever you are using the Lifetime Traffic Updates",screen
I have the TomTom XXL 530TM and TomTom GO730 which came with the Lifetime Traffic Updates but do not have to deal with the annoying advertisement running across the top of screen like that of the Garmin Nuvi 1350LMT 4,screen
It has a 5 Inch large screen with Lifetime Traffic & Lifetime Map Updates,screen
3 inch screen and the GPS mount is sufficient for its size,screen
"The first thing you will notice is the screen; sharp, bright and viewable in almost all conditions",screen
"It is indeed nice, and did I mentioned the screen? [is, did, mentioned] [nice]
",screen
"After I got the screen back to normal it said no maps available, as of now I haven't down loaded new maps",screen
Another annoyance is that the information on the distance to my next turn isn't always displayed on the screen,screen
"If you don't touch the screen on the 3790LMT, you'll get a verbal warning of the upcoming turn about a half mile before the turn",screen
"The nuvi 1490 is a waste of money, please look for another model unless you like getting rip off, the newer models use a cheap thin peice of glass to protect the touch screen and obviously cant even handel mild climate changes in a car",screen
"When I try to scroll along the suggested path, to get a better idea of where I'm heading, the screen simply does not move with my finger, no matter how slow or deliberate I move my finger, the map jumps from place to place and highlights different areas of the map,asking whether I want it to set this as my new destination",screen
"I've used other touch screen devices, none of which have been as frustrating as this pos",screen
"I have also had this gps shut off on me multiple times in a trip from Boise to Sacramento, I'd say at least four times it just reset itself and started at the main screen",screen
"At one point it was still talking as though it was set on a route, but it was at the main screen displaying ""Where to"" and ""Map""",screen
It feels more solid and the touchscreen works far better,screen
Would be nice to have both current and next street/road on navigation screen,screen
"Also, it would be nice to see name of every street shown on a screen when maximum detail is selected",screen
"the main disadvantage in my Garmin 1390 is the touch screen that I have to touch the each letter average 3-4 times to be accepted, plus I MUST enter correct spellingfor city and street, this was too hard , so I returned it for full refund BTW , the Lan assistant picture is fake, I drove in NY metro area and on different highways and never got the picture they r showing for lane assistant Also the traffic feature when enabled in Manhattan , the street found closed for three months and the GPS guided me in circles insisting to go thru the closed street, so the live traffic update is fake as well I bought another Magelan without the traffic support , and I'm really happy with it now",screen
"Without this problem, this unit is very good with a big screen and fast capturing of satellite signals",screen
"The large screen is good (I Velcro it to the lower dash area under the radio and although it doesn't fit there as well as the 5 inch Garmin, it works ok)",screen
"16) Where Am I  was a useful feature showing Hospital, Police and Fuel  it would be nice to scroll on this screen to find additional information",screen
I bought this Garmin 1450 for ordinary navigating purposes but am irritated to find advertising showing up on the screen constantly,screen
"Before I buy this, I already have an older nuvi with a 3 in screen",screen
"Second, the letters on the keyboard are much smaller than older models (despite having a bigger screen) making it difficult to type",screen
"3) New graphics style- They have managed to make the same information on same size screen (I tried the 765, exact same software as 1490t) looks smaller with new menu button right in the middle of the main navigation route",screen
"Basically the 5 inch screen is nice, and compared to 660 ability for multi point routing is good",screen
"12) At power up the display does not automatically rivert to map view if you dont do anything, instead the main menu screen which is useless to watch while driving",screen
"14) No MP3 or Audio Books or FM transmitter or line out (I can live without so not big for me, line out would have been nice to hook up with your car audio) Improvements 1) Bigger screen, but less glossy 2)No anntenna on the back, beautiful exterior design, looks more sturdy 3) Power attaches to unit not base holder",screen
"765 seems to have the same features minus the 5inch screen and $200 cheaper, so may consider that or studying other tom tom too",screen
"the touch screen, which you really only use when browsing the map, is wacky",screen
"It's even less responsive than my old one, and when you try to move the screen it slides crazily out of control",screen
The screen is smaller but other than that it beats the Garmin in almost every way,screen
First of all I was surprised how sluggish and slow this Garmin was: redrawing map was painfully slow and sometimes it could leave you with nothing on the screen for approximately 5 second before map was re-drawn,screen
"On the positive side, the graphics and screen quaily are amazing but the lack of user friendlyness ruins it for me",screen
Driver and passenger cannot see the screen at the same time,screen
Suggestion: If buying ANY GPS insist on taking it outside into the sunshine to see if the screen is visible,screen
It has a good sized screen and all the usual Garmin software features plus traffic updates (which I haven't tried),screen
"I decided I should get a system with lifetime maps and a wider screen, so the 1300 appeared to be the perfect fit",screen
"This makes using this unit, with its big screen and all of its ""special features"", significantly less of a pleasure than it should be",screen
"The Magellan has one only if it turns the entire screen while driving -   if you are going south, then your map is upside down, and you have to mentally figure out to turn left rather   than right because the map is upside down",screen
Then suddenly I got a white screen with a dot that keeps moving around the screen as you push the dot,screen
* Inconsistent way to move back a screen,screen
"On some screens you press ""Done"", on most you press ""Menu",screen
I would be driving along and all of a sudden all by itself this unit would start detecting touches on the screen without anything touching the unit,screen
"I called Garmin, and they walked me through a factory reset of the device (touch the bottom right of the screen and power on the device to reload all the software)",screen
"I pulled off for some much needed gas, which by the way, there is no way to have POIs appear on the screen of the Garmin while the Tom Tom can have POIs appear without taking your eyes from the road and hitting four or five screens",screen
This one has advertizements and cupon offers that pop up in the middle of the screen and it appears that the only way to get them off so that you can see the map fully is to manually change the screen,screen
These Ads block important information on the screen and the frequency in which they are displayed seems to have something to do with the area you are driving in,screen
It has a long ways to go to catch up to a smart phone's responsive touch screen,screen
What I liked about the Garmin 1490T was the larger screen,screen
What I don't like about the larger screen is that Garmin did not increase the resolution,screen
It is just an old GPS with a slightly bigger screen,screen
The screen would change to a search screen but the GPS would only be searching a partial address,screen
"The 1350T is easy to use, the screen is easy to read and address input is great",screen
"No lane change advisory ever happened in 16 hours of drive, no overhead signs ever appeared on screen",screen

It does look slick and is comfortable in terms of the touch screen inputs,screen
The software is not lane-aware (or at least the screen layout of road does not differentiates between the lanes) although a screen-shot on the product page and the (same) image on the back of the box gives the impression otherwise,screen
"Whats good and not in the 760: -Bigger 5 inch screen -Lifetime Maps and Traffic -Lane Assist -3D map option, map auto zoom set by speed -Eco Route + ability to buy additional module to plug into engine to read engine diagnostic codes",screen

"Low Fidelity Maps: Despite having a higher screen size, it DOES NOT have higher resolution than much smaller units",screen
"I love that it says the street names, it has a really large screen, search is much more efficient on this version, and lifetime maps and traffic is great as well",screen
This became a huge problem in Minnesota where I was forced to just follow the path on the screen as many of the roadway names were incorrect,screen
"However, it arrived with a defect on the display: The screen shows a permanent vertical pink line in the middle of it",screen
They still don't take full advantage of a touch screen,screen
"It's nice to have in addition to the iPhone, since it will automatically recalculate the route for you and the screen is bigger, but the iPhone often has better route suggestions",screen
"I bought the 1490LMT because of the positive reviews, the price, the screen size and the ability to get Europe maps for it",screen
"In addition to sometimes having to repeat myself several times, even in a quiet car with the windows closed (and I do not have a strong accent that would make it difficult for the device to understand me), the voice commands do not have all the functionality of selecting destinations that the touchscreen-driven menu has",screen
"Also, the voice command menus do not list distance information when you 'find by address', so in order to get that information, you must use the touchscreen-driven menu",screen
"So to Garmin, we said ""pass"" and ended up paying $150 less for a navigation device (not a marketing device) that offered a larger screen",screen
"This compares to my 4-5 yr old Garmin nuvi, but has a bigger screen",screen
"The touch screen is made for small fingers and not sensitive to anyone with big hands, girl friend can use it fine but I have to hunt n' peck my way through the buttons",screen
The screen quality is good and so are the features,screen
I have found the screen size to be no problem like some of other reviewers have,screen
Even after the four inch screen I was use to on my old 265T,screen
It does have a bright clear screen and easy to program,screen
"""Back"" was my only option, which sometimes required that I go back several screens",screen
Spent much too much time trying to figure out why nothing happened when I tapped the eraser in the upper right corner of the screen to correct a typo,screen
"Checked the ""Help"" menu on the device and found the following entry regarding calibrating the screen: ""1",screen
Follow the on-screen instructions,screen
Press and hold the top left corner of the touchscreen 3,screen
"Continue holding the top left of the screen, after 30 seconds, a small  dot will appear 5",screen
"Before discovering how to calibrate the screen, and out of utter frustration, I was very close to calling Amazon and sending the unit back, assuming that it was defective",screen
"Since I am in the complaint mode, it is also worth mentioning that getting back to the main screen (depending on where you are) can involve many taps on the screen",screen
"It's really big, very clear screen, and picks up the satellites very quickly",screen
"It was jerky, it zoomed off-screen, and I had to repeatedly zoom out to re-center the map",screen
"The screen is great, far better than other low res gps units, the speaker is loud enough to be heard easily and the size and appearance of the unit is excellent",screen
We like the big screen and the way the information is provided,screen
I need this because I wear distance glasses to drive and have a real problem seeing the smaller GPS screens,screen
The other day I had to remove the unit from the dash and let the air conditioner vents blow on the screen until it started working again,screen
"Garmin 1450 LM - After having the Garmin 350 (with a 3"" screen) for 5-years, I was ready to upgrade to a larger (5"") screen",screen
I bought this for my wife who likes a larger screen because she has macular problems,screen
"Overall it's ok, but I think TomTom is more accurate even with bigger screens",screen
"At least Garmin lets me change how much data is on the screen, but normal and most seem to be the same and are way, way less than my old gps",screen
It would not make the beep when we would push the on-screen button (as it does when the volume is set to an audible level and/or the mute is off) and would not respond to our selection,screen
"My familiarity with the sequence of on-screen commands to adjust the brightness of the display luckily allowed me to adjust the brightness level to a higher level, my spouse was not familiar with the unit and could do nothing because the screen was just grey",screen
The second time I tried to use this GPS the screen went white,screen
I'm willing to give up all the cool features and nice big touch screen for a little more detail,screen
"Did a hard power down, let it rest for an hour, turned it back on and it went into a constant loop of the garmin splash screen, unit never came back to life",screen
"My only issue with the device, aside from bricking itself, was the pop-up ad's that appeared on screen",screen
"pros:big screen, does a fair job of doing basic routes, stores pictures cons:""intelligent"" via point optimization is stupid, so is the eco-route feature, it cut out in the middle of my trip a couple times",screen
There is a white horizontal line through the middle of the screen and it is visually disruptive,screen
Unlike other GPs's this one does NOT show you the POI's as you are moving on your destination screen,screen
I LOVE the touch-screen capability,screen
"Setting up favorite places and destinations is VERY easy -- n&uuml;vi has several common destinations already in its database - including shopping, lodging, banks, parks, and other points of interest, or you can enter your own (either by address or name) using the onscreen keyboard",screen
"The screen display will change from a white-backed map to a dark-backed map as the light level drops, and this minimizes having a glaring bright image on your dashboard at night",screen
"From the Garmin website, you can customize your vehicle's on-screen appearance using several different options (including ""holiday"" images), navigator voices, upload JPG images to customize details, get games (although for the life of me, I don't know WHY you would want games on a GPS unit) and subscribe to traffic updates (the LM means you get free lifetime-map updates, but if you want traffic information, you'll have to subscribe to that feature",screen
"30, it flashes the junctions of the highway for  a split second splitting the screen like in the new 2012 before displaying the whole junction like in the 1400's",screen
My guess is that garmin is trying to accomdate the newer 2012 way where it splits the screen and the old 2011 way where junctions are shown in full screen,screen
Can Garmin please fix it so that future map updates are compatible with the 2011 junction view of just showing the full screen view and stop flashing the junction for a split second in half screen mode,screen
"When I drive I always go to the screen that displays the route instructions, instead of leaving the screen with the one line instruction above the (useless) map",screen
"The fancy, flashy big screen and other bells and whistles can't compare the the older nuvi 360",screen
"My guess is that when there are momentary blips in voltage, it senses the charger is unplugged and replugged, it resets itself and usually takes a couple of minutes to go through the Garmin screens to be useful again",screen
"Worse is when sometimes it would show a startup screen (showing an icon of it connected to a computer) and it wouldn't restart itself - usually holding the power button down would get it to stop so we could restart it, but several times it just hung",screen
As mentioned previously in reviews I was surprised when I kept getting best western ads on my screen,screen
"At first it seemed great; it's very thin with a bright beautiful screen, the 3d mapping is super cool in the city, and the Bluetooth and voice control worked fine",screen
"3 screen as the 1350LMT does, so the 1350 is no improvement there, and the old 650 nuvi's screen is much clearer - brighter with better contrast than the 1350 - a major downgrade with the 1350",screen
"The GPS part of the unit works fantastic, great screen, very user-friendly and easy to operate",screen
"All the bells and whistles of nice touch screen and smooth design are good, but if this does not get you where you want to, what is the use",screen
The touch screen was also not very responsive and the entire user experience was pretty miserable,screen
"I initially wanted the 3760 for the lifetime traffic, but I've read how unreliable that it is and that you have to deal with advertisements on the screen - nothing is ""free"", remember",screen
I am thinking that a clear cover on top of the screen would make the touch feature less sensitive even though it would protect the screen,screen
"I think that there is a way to turn off the screen when running on internal battery power, it may even be automatic, but my screen never shut off",screen
"You cannot see any roads names on map display, what the big screen is for? [see, is] [big]
",screen
"3"" screen is probably the best size for most people and cars",screen
I did notice that the screen icons and menus have changed somewhat between the c340 and the 1390LMT,screen
"Similar in many ways but just different enough that if you are familiar with the old layout, the new layout will frustrate you a bit until you un-learn the old way of navigating the menus/screens",screen
"One thing that really frustrates me is that  ""Spell Name"" for a location requires an additional screen touch",screen
The touchscreen on the 1390LMT is quite responsive and accurate,screen
Screen brightness is good and the screen can be seen pretty well even in bright light although it does wash out a little,screen
"The screen also does a pretty good job in the glare department, reducing it to a manageable level",screen
"When you click that button on-screen, it shows you your exact latitude and longitude coordinates, the nearest address and intersection, and the closest hospitals, police stations and fuel stations",screen
"To be totally fair, I do not own it and was not able to use it while driving, but as far as navigating the menus and using the touchscreen, I spent quite a bit of time with it and in my opinion the Garmin is much easier to operate",screen
The Garmin menu system and touchscreen was simply a better overall experience for me,screen
I took a while to get it to a useful screen,screen
The screen display has the night mode which is more easy to see at night,screen
"Pros: user-friendly interface, usually plots the best routes to my destination,text-to-speech, automatic day/night screen change, free map update within 30 days of purchase (generally, Garmin maps are more updated), lifetime traffic, lane assist (a must have when you are in unfamiliar territory), Bluetooth (connected to my env touch with ease and the connection is stable",screen
"4) The unit shows which lane to use on freeways, which is useful Disadvantages over the old model: 1) The power cord is much thicker and harder to hide 2) MAJOR DISADVANTAGE - the unit uses an obtrusive 1/8th of its screen for unsolicited advertising that Garmin call 'Offers'",screen
The 1390 would cut out and go to a black screen a lot in Louisiana and some spots in Texas,screen
just doesnt look and feel like it ll stand up to the time -it takes alot of pressure to push on buttons on the screen or slide (compared to a cell) -i leave my house and it takes between 30-48 minutes for traffic to populate,screen
if you use your google maps traffic on your phone traffic appears on the same screen on your route map,screen

"It just shows one little icon on the screen with the total traffic delay on the route but doesn't show when the delay will start (if you go into the traffic interface with two clicks you can navigate to such a screen, but this is very important information for a driver to have to make a decision if they want to exit)",screen
"Pros: Large screen, detailed lane choice",screen
In Tom-tom- sound signal and small flashing object on the screen,screen
") and you get a warning with ""OK"" that must be pressed on the screen",screen
"You are left without any help, not to mention how dangerous can it be to be forced to press the screen while driving",screen
The + and - zoom buttons work as good as pinching the screen (apple),screen
One last gripe: there is no Home button to return you to the main screen,screen
If you are into the system hunting destinations or changing settings you may have to back up 6 or more steps to get back to the main screen,screen
I miss the touch screen from older model it was much better,screen
"TomTom lets me show time needed to destination, miles left, arrival time, direction of travel all on the same screen",screen
It really doesn't take much space and TomTom One screen is smaller than the nuvi-1300,screen
"User sees no road on the screen for a few seconds then roads show up again, can be pretty scary at times",screen
"I like the features and screen size, wish the lane change screen displayed a little longer than it does",screen
"Now I have a lines across the top of the screen, it is not displaying speed correctly and it won't update maps, so I have to return it for for a replacement and pay for shipping back to garmin, not happy about that! [have, is, displaying, update, have, return, shipping, garmin] [happy]
",screen
"(It is not recommended to have a checkmark next to Highways or Toll Roads) Touch OK For the touchscreen, please use light and quick taps rather than long or hard presses",screen
"Less than 3 months later, four horizontal white dotted lines and one vertical teal line now appear on the screen anytime the unit is on",screen
"A few days later, the map disappeared from the screen",screen
I ordered this device because I liked the larger screen size and the bluetooth feature,screen
"I like the bigger and wider screen, and some of the improvements including lane options displayed visually to make sure you're driving on the correct lane when exiting or merging onto highway traffic",screen
"As for adjusting the volume, I don't like that I have to go through more than 2 screens to do this on the Garmin",screen
"It shows ""calculating"" at the top of the screen but voices it as well (more than once sometimes), whereas the Magellan just shows it at the top of the screen but remains silent (which I like better)",screen
"On the Garmin, if you touch ETA then you have another screen where you must select what other information you'd rather see",screen
"One other thing, when I'm taking freeways/tollways and the Garmin tells me to exit, it shows at the top of the screen the name of the exit but the voice just says the name of the freeway I'm on",screen
I much prefer to hear the correct exit name so I don't have to check the screen and read it,screen
"It gives you all the usual stuff that you would expect from a new, big screen Navigation system",screen
"For the price it has many nice features when it works, like lane assist, eco-tour, easy to view screen, easy to hear, easy to adjust settings, easy to find, enter & navigate to destinations",screen
Whats the use in having a 5inch screen when you have ads,screen
"To get the good things out of the way: (And why I even gave it two stars)  - A nice, crisp screen  - Small and sleek, easily mistaken for a smartphone  - The detour function works well  - Mostly routed routes correctly, albeit rather slowly",screen
"If you do buy one, use the screen as you will most likely get lost following the voice prompts",screen
Then I end up missing my turn because I have to fumble around with the stupid thing (while trying to drive) in order to get my map back up on screen,screen
"As a point of reference, it is possible to create products that have reliable touchscreens and I would pay a premium to get one that would continue to function",screen
"PROS -Great price -Nice big, easy to see screen -Includes all necessary accessories -Voice guidance is plenty loud CONS -Slow to acquire GPS location -Recalculating route takes too long -Voice guidance sounds raspy -Some quirkiness in route selection (it did get me to where I was going though)",screen
"My first impression was that it was thinner than my iphone, bright clear screen, and over all impressive looking",screen
It simply give you a little box on the top left of the screen with the color above,screen
"Again, by the time you get that red box on the screen, it's too late to do anything about it",screen
The main positive feature of this unit is the screen size,screen
""" If you want a big screen navigation unit, this is currently your best choice (though I suspect Navigon will soon have an app for the iPad)",screen
"I can say my previous Garmin that was stolen had some very serious problems with locking, long satellite access times and a horribly difficult to use screen keyboard, so I am going to be really, really careful what I buy this time",screen
I found it worked best if I touched the screen only with a hard object - like a pen,screen
"It has a great screen, is easy to use & it is fun to choose the look of your own vehicle",screen
"If you then power off while still plugged into electrical outlet, then you will get a message on screen if battery is charging or if it is fully charged",screen
"I was looking forward to a newer unit with a larger screen, and with the lifetime updates, thought it would be pretty good",screen
"The big clear diagram of where you are supposed to turn disappears as it shrinks to half size, and a photo of the intersection appears on the other half of the split screen",screen
They changed the screen layout so that the little numbers showing your speed are right next to the posted speed limit,screen
"What this means is that if you touch your choice at a slight angle, as often happens, your choice scrolls off screen without activating",screen
The old touch screen was better,screen
"The 5"" screen didn't seem like a big upgrade on paper, but in use it is a LOT bigger than the 4",screen
Our new Garmin GPS shows us on non-existant roads on the screen and MANY speed limits on the GPS are not correct,screen
"Terrible touchscreen, errors about 20% of the time which when you have to type 8-15 characters for even the simplest address is mindboggling",screen
"coming from previous models, this one is a bit buggy, it seems like the UI was poorly designed, and there are a couple annoyances: Good: - Unit is accurate - Screen is great (tho the touch screen could be better, it's acceptable for the cost) Bad: - ""Traffic Included"" costs extra (they sell with or without traffic, for about $40 more depending on where you buy",screen
"What I wanted was a larger screen, thinner profile and hopefully better overall performance",screen
And of course the wide screen and overall screen display is a nice upgrade from what I was accustomed to,screen
Unfortunately the Nuvi 1300 also has its share of annoyances the most bothersome is the operation of the touchscreen,screen
If the screen was bigger and more volume the item would be a winner,screen
"While I like the large screen and visual ease of this unit, I take exception with the directions I receive from the ""Garmin Lady",screen
"On the plus side, it has a large, bright easy to see screen and does warn you of traffic problems ahead",screen
"You should be able to easily select a route in the database and see the names of the origin, destination, and all waypoints on a scrollable screen",screen
""" button the next screen shows icons for various types of destinations",screen
""" you must first select the ""Near"" button at the bottom of the next screen and type in or select what your destination is near",screen
"The good: The unit is well designed,light, slim, and sports a gorgeous glass screen",screen
"The screen itself is clear, bright and wonderful to look at",screen
"If you're used to interacting with an iPhone or Android device, you're probably used to the screen registering touches without any effort",screen
This can be downright dangerous when trying to answer a handsfree call by touching the screen while driving and having to focus and press hard so the screen registers the touch,screen
Worked great until the 4th week when it bricked and would not run anything other than the screen calibration,screen
"3"" screen (5"" seemed to big), lifetime maps (after being appalled to learn that Garmin wanted $40 for a single map update for an older unit), optional traffic, spoken street names, speed limit display, multi-point routing, and lane assist",screen
"I wish Garmin will give comsumer more control of what to show at screen, and also allow cusumer to download and choose display of other models",screen
I want to try the new NUVI 50 model display where I can see the split screen with static junction view,screen
And I wish LIKE CRAZY for larger screens,screen
I can't say enough about the new thin screens and their nice connection to the ball connector on the bean bag,screen
"I would like to rate this unit higher, but I still keep going back to my old Garmin 7200 (beloved HUGE screen), which is falling apart, but still so much easier to use",screen
"This unit is just kind of a backup, even though the mounting, screen and many other things are nicer",screen
The biggest problem we have experienced is the view on the screen keeps changing from a good driving map,screen
Another issue is that if you touch the screen to zoom-in you are given a screen to select a local location and it is nearly impossible no to select this even when you do not want to select the local featured item,screen
In fact we use the smaller screened older Garmin more often than this new one,screen
Good features and nice screen too bad it does not work as well as it should,screen
"We love the large screen, it's easy to use and see for driver and passengers",screen
"It has a nice screen, worked for a few time and less than 60 days after purchase froze up and I can't get it to work",screen
"(Note: although the startup screen in this device warns against using it while driving, it would be useless when approaching busy intersections while driving given the other faults mentioned below due to which it calculates wrong routes at the beginning of the drive, making it essential for me to set different routes while driving)",screen
Pros: 1) Wide screen - it helps to avoid any significant distraction for your eyes in order to stay attentive on the roadway,screen
"Great job garmin, I just spent $250 on a GPS that wont even let me get pass the opening screen",screen
Pros: The wide screen is a great improvement over the smaller screen I was used to on the 360,screen
The color is much more vivid and the screen is much brighter,screen
"When traffic information is being received, a traffic icon shows up in the upper left of the screen",screen
"It was pretty easy to enter info and find destination, screen was of ample size and very clear",screen
"I love the screen, size, and features, but there are 2 major problems",screen
"The unit is very compact but the relatively smallish screen is very clear and crisp, very easy to read while driving",screen
The screen's responsiveness is good IMHO,screen
"As said in some other reviews the volume is not too great but that is not a real issue to me, as I'm more keen on looking at the screen than listening to what it's telling me",screen
3 inch screen Garmin 1390LMT against the 5 inch TomTom 1530TM because they're about the same price and have lifetime map and traffic updates,screen
3 inch screen is kind of small when using the keyboard so I sometimes press the wrong letter,screen
#NAME?,screen
"the 5"" screen was easy to read",screen
I found myself referring to the little speed limit sign on the map screen more than I expected,screen
"The QWERTY keyboard screen had an intermittent dead spot in the vicinity of the ""N"" and ""M"" where, sometimes, no amount of touching/pressing/mashing would get a response",screen
One of my biggest complaints during my de facto trial period was that you could not pan/scroll the map screen,screen
"I love the size of this GPS, I almost got the 1490t, but read some reviews and determined that I really didn't need the screen that big",screen
"The screen size is fine, but trying to pick a destination was a exercise in patience",screen
They have enlarged the screen and REMOVED necessary details such as road names from the map even when it's set to the maps MOST DETAIL setting,screen
"It was, at first, simply frozen and then, after a few minutes, turned completely white displaying no roads or anything else on the screen",screen
The voice system continued to give directions but they were virtually useless without the screen to look at,screen
This time my little car on the screen laid down a purple trail as I drive along on the orange highway,screen
It is easy to program and the onscreen menus are convenient,screen
It is thin and reasonably light and portable and the screen is big,screen
"It began by getting a ""fuzzy"" screen and then it went black",screen
"However, as GPS screens increase in size, it's annoying that Garmin hasn't made better use of them",screen
"The Garbin designers can't seem to find enough to room on the screen to tell you what street you're on (the question does arise sometimes) and the default map screen provides only two pieces of information at a time, one of which is always speed, one of the less-useful pieces of information",screen
"There's an option to turn on more information, but that screen has the look of something Garmin hobbled together when too many people complained",screen
Turning the extra information on or off requires leaving the map screen and going into the settings -- not recommended while driving,screen
"Since I started using it, it is becoming more and more difficult to enter ""spelling"" on the touch screen",screen
"Some areas of the screen seem to respond to touch easily but for most areas of the screen, I have to repeatedly press on a letter, with a lot of force, to get it accepted",screen
"I've used touch screens on high-end automobiles (Lexus and Mercedes), and tablets like the Galaxy and the Ipad",screen
It feels cheap when you attempt to finger the touch screen,screen
Traffic updates are worthless on account of the ads that obscure the already too small screen,screen
"When I lifted my finger off the screen, the map would zoom off in a random direction, so that the field of interest wasn't on the screen any longer",screen
"As another reviewer pointed out going from a 4"" screen to a 5"" screen makes a really big difference",screen
with 1 minor and 1 MAJOR annoyance: Minor: I can't seem to figure out how to get my current speed to not display on the screen,screen
"On the homepage every time you turn it on, there is an ""offer bar"" that displays coupons for nearby businesses across the top of the screen, slightly blocking the ""Where to? [turn, is, displays, blocking] [nearby]
",screen
"But if you watch closely for a while (not a good idea while driving), you'll notice that its not updating the screen",screen
the only thing on the screen is Garmin,screen
"Buyers should be aware that the ""lifetime subscription to Navtraffic"" is actually an FM (as in FM radio) ad based service that pops ads onto your screen based on your location",screen
You have to touch the screen to get rid of the ad,screen
After few hours of use black screen appeared,screen
"You cannot pan and zoom using voice and you can't switch to the ""data"" screen from the map (but you can go the other way)",screen
This GPS has good size of the screen,screen
"However, on a longer trip (80 miles each way) the Garmin proved to be so inept at routing, flexibility of operation, choice and quantity of screen display items that we returned it and bought (nervously) a second XXL to use as a back up",screen
"Do any of you touch the screen and zoom out to look for ""alternate routes"" or where you are overall in ""map format""? [Do, touch, zoom, look, are] [alternate, overall]
",screen
"Well - when I touched the screen -it didn't respond right and it kept marking the screen where I touched and asked ""go to this new destination? [touched, did, respond, kept, marking, touched, asked, go] [right, new]
",screen
"When you use the keyboard to spell a location or enter an address, there is a 1-3 second delay from when you press a key to when the letter shows up on the screen",screen
In spite of a bigger screen this model has no tenths readouts making it crippled in use for walking and biking,screen
"Pros Nice screen (very nice) excellent voice quality feels nicely built and is quite heavy 4 free updates per year over speed limit warning Cons POP UP ADS! [Nice, feels, built, is, warning] [nice, excellent, heavy, free]
",screen
"To turn it off, you have to still select OFF or CANCEL from the ons-screen menu",screen
"To turn it back on, you have to press the button, then tap the on-screen lock twice to return the unit to operation before you can start the shut-down sequence again",screen
"Blocks about 10% of the screen - no instructions in manual, or set-up munu to toggle off the annoying ads - ad stays on screen until you leave the vicinity of the business - very distracting",screen
This Garmin has some nice features and the screen is decent for the price,screen
"has a bigger, easier-to-see screen 2",screen
The 680 had a much more sensitive touch screen,screen
Other screens don't compare to the clarity,screen
"I typed in my hotel addresses and it located most except the ones in smaller towns, however, I just have to tap the screen where I think the hotel is located and a text bubble comes up saying ""Road"", I save that location and rename it with the hotel name",screen
I have seen other gps screens and my biggest beef is that the map looks confusing,screen
"The screen has vibrantly crisp colors to distinguish screen/map features (but the older one does, too) and the GPS keeps up very well",screen
"Some of the things i liked about the unit were: The screen size,good graphics,easy to see",screen
You try to get back to the startup screen and the back arrow will not work,screen
Positives: The large screen is really nice,screen
"I just bought this because of the great price, 5"" screen, lifetime map updates and maps of the US and Canada",screen
"Strike 6 - When viewing the full set of data, the map screen is half size",screen
"I have a need for something that gives clear-voiced, efficient directions, and provides a readable screen in sunlight",screen
"Huge screen, lots of info displayed such as speed, speed limit, ETA, etc",screen
"A small popup occasionally appears, usually 1 or 2 lines, and takes up very little of the screen",screen
"In the beginning it was fun discovering all the features, and we really enjoyed the traffic feature and large screen",screen
The Nuvi1450LM has a nice bright screen with much less detail than our 2460,screen
"The process has a few places where things could go wrong, so follow the on-screen instructions carefully, and check the power settings on your computer to be sure it doesn't enter sleep or hibernation mode",screen
Everything works as advertised except the lock screen function,screen
Too much information on the screen is the biggie,screen
ALSO -- I don't like that the lower right corner of the screen is hard-wired for your travel speed and the speed limit,screen
The touch screen is user-friendly and sensitive,screen
So during the day it is difficult to see something on the screen,screen
"This is an excellent GPS unit, but when looking at all the options you have out in the marketplace in the similar 5 inch screen size, just factor in that Tomtom provides the traffic camera coverage free; but for this GPS you have to sell out ~$30 per year",screen
I think a lot is very subjective - my first GPS was a TomTom and I liked it but wanted a bigger screen and this Garmin was priced right and had lifetime map and traffic updates,screen
The onscreen advertising is a real nuisance and only serves to make me not want to purchase anything they are advertising,screen
The 5 inch screen is nice but no big deal compared to the 3,screen
"* The screen is very bright, vibrant, and easy to see in any light",screen
"* When in 2D mode (after clicking anywhere on the map in the 3D view), if your car drives off the screen, it does not re-center or otherwise attempt to scroll the map back to where your car is",screen
"However, a major problem with the 1490t is that too often, this ""starting point"" (origin end of the purple line) is set behind you, or off to the side, often barely even on the screen",screen
"If you're lucky, you might see a portion of the purple line somewhere on the screen, which you can drive to and it will then pick up routing from there",screen
"Also, sometimes going down the road, using the Garmin, it will suddenly switch to some other screen, even though I haven't touched it, and there wasn't a bump in the road",screen
"Comparing to my $100 3 year old Navigon, the big screen and bluetooth are definitely plus and works well",screen
I am returning my 2360 because it's essentially IMPOSSIBLE to read the screen while driving in bright sunlight,screen
The suction mount has been changed and the screen brightness (even at MAX brightness) and contrast are much poorer than my 680,screen
The 2360 power cord interferes with the new mount so that the screen cannot be pointed true up/down (i,screen
"If not for the poor screen brightness I'd take them up on this, but even the mount can't make the screen readable in bright sun though my 680 (positioned right alongside for comparison) was easy to read",screen
"The screen was a little smaller vertically, but larger horizontally, and the screen itself looked sharp, although the text was a little smaller, and thus a little harder to read while driving",screen
The two serious concerns I have deal with the screen brightness at night and the black suction cup that is used for mounting,screen
"The only solution I have found is to purchase a heavy tinted film from a car window tinting business, customize it to your screen, and put it on at night and take it off during the day",screen
It has a wider screen the is easier to read during the daytime,screen
"The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?

Switch to another screen to read more about this fabulous deal,screen
"These Ads appear on the screen every few minutes in metro areas, blocking the map display, and there is no way to get rid of them",screen
"The screen is gorgeous but not worth the trouble, especially at this price",screen
Disappointed that 1/3 of screen taken by buttons making total view less than my other 4,screen
"The slow response time, tendency of the screen to freeze and poor accuracy make it easy to drive right past your turn and trigger the all too familiar ""Recalculating""",screen
The GPS would also tell me to turn left when the screen would show a right turn,screen
It does not look as great and I really hate the crummy window mount and the way the cable attaches to the GPS but the 5 inch screen is nice,screen
The screen has a lot more detail to it than the Garmin,screen
"3"" screen and its search capabilities for street addresses is very quick",screen
* Routing is accurate overall (same as other Garmins) * Good build quality (metallic body) * Great windshield mount design with built-in speaker and power port (Garmin always wins in this area) * The Touch screen is more responsive than my old 765T but still flimsy at times,screen

"After doing a bit more homework I discovered that I could get a GPS with a larger screen and more GPS features (instead of pointless bells and whistles) for about the same price as I paid for the 295W, so I am going to return it to Amazon",screen
I would suggest to anyone in the market for a GPS to pass up the Garmin 295W for something with a bigger screen and more robust GPS features,screen

Couple of times I traveled extra mile before I realized that the GPS screen stuck,screen
The touch screen and the user interface are good,screen
"Why I purchased this GPS is because I wanted a bigger screen with good graphics and lane assist, but it is not worth it",screen
Because they allow more info to be put on the screen without robbing you of valuable map space as does this Garmin unit,screen
"Some times it does not display names of several street on the screen and only display major street name that is many blocks away, even in ""more detail"" setting",screen

I like the bigger screen and I like the traffic reports but beware it's not always accurate,screen
4 model (1350LMT) when I traded it for this model for the bigger screen nor had the opportunity to compare it to 2012 models,screen
I was shocked after paying premium price for this item and it has pop up adds that cover a significant amount of the screen-and you can't shut them off if you use the traffic function-which is why I bought the device,screen
"It is really unsafe to have it pop up-Best Western add-you can't get rid of it and they told me it stays on your product unless you are going over 30 mph-which means when you need a clear screen most in traffic, then you have a popup blocking some of your sceen-I am returning mine-it is horrible",screen
"If I went to another screen for entering names, the ABC keybord worked fine and the number button was active too",screen
"In general, both devices work well and the screen on the 1370T is an improvement over the 370",screen
"The 5"" display is nice, and being able to move the map by swiping the screen with your fingers is a nice improvement over the old unit",screen
3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Traffic & Map Updates</a>updated list of area amenities and one wonders why Garmin has not done so after more than a year,screen
Best feature is the large view screen and the road junction preview feature,screen
"- Once you got an address in place and told the 1300 to route you, the screen would indicate you were in the same place",screen
"I liked the lane assist, the traffic function, and the wide screen",screen
I returned it for another nuvi 1490 and on Thursday as I was driving around downtown Los Angles the screen turned off,screen
Garmin Nuvi 1450 is a no frills portable GPS receiver with a 5 inch screen,screen
The screen size of 5 inch makes the map easy to see and read,screen
"The wide 5'' screen is a plus, and the directions are easy to follow",screen
"I could turn it off by holding the power button down, but it came back on to the same screen (It wouldn't STAY off, either) , even though it WAS plugged into my computer",screen
"No tiny hole to poke something into, or anything, and holding down the power switch just restarted it back to the same screen",screen
"It looks amazing, the screen is great but it fails to do what it is meant to",screen
The new magellan 32xx series have a very bright screen much better than garmin's,screen
Its got a large screen which is a huge plus,screen
The screen is the only thing going for it,screen
Got it out and plugged it in the next morning and the screen flashed white then the Garmin name appeared - that is where it sits today,screen
"Nothing works - it comes on and flashes a white screen and then the word ""garmin"" on the screen and it sits there",screen
"Very nice wide screen display - much nicer than my old Garmin Speed limit indicator - this is helpful when you turn onto a street and you don't know the speed limit Free map and traffic updates - I have to pay extra for these features on my unit, which would end up costing more than a new 1390 over a period of two years",screen
"Now for the bad Sound quality is nowhere near as nice as the Garmin StreetPilot c580 Ad supported traffic is very annoying, especially when an ad appears somewhere on the screen that you need to see Touching an ad will lock up the screen Upgrading to premium (no ads) option is not possible on this unit Turning off ads is possible, but not as simple as it should be (BTW it also turns off traffic updates) I would like to upgrade, but for me, there are too many (mostly ad related) negatives",screen
"The nicer screen and speed limit indicator are not enough incentive to switch units, and the older maps are usually correct, so I just need to buy updates once every two or three years",screen
"Tom Tom seems to work better in this respect - your next turn is always on the screen even if it's in 60 miles, so you can be sure to stay in the correct lange",screen
"Garmin did a decent job at cribbing the design characteristics that make Apple products so desirable- thinness and beautiful screen, accelerometer, etc",screen
"Although the 5"" screen size is nice and the graphics  are great, I found the robo",screen
"When navigating we frequently want to be able to zoom in, out and panning to see where we are and where we are going WITHOUT the hassle of touching the screen and got distracted",screen
In the nuvi 670 and other units as you zoom in more and more you would see point of interests appearing on the screen and this is very helpful as it would give you an idea what are available in that area,screen
The older unit has one nag screen at each startup,screen
"The new unit has added a second nag screen to startup that won't go away until you click ""I Agree"" to all the legalese *every time* you start the unit -- a real PIA",screen
"That feature alone enticed me, in addition to the larger screen, the qwerty keyboard and the faster signal reception",screen
") after a few minutes and you MUST power back on and unlock the screen! [MUST, unlock] [few]
",screen
o The screen does auto-change orientation whether holding 'landscape' or 'portrait',screen
"We like the newer screen features, that have been added",screen
Be aware that in order to use the traffic updating YOU MUST allow yourself to be spammed with advertising and coupons that pop up on the screen,screen
It seems to take a long time for the infomation to get to the screen,screen
"What a pleasure to read their demeaning, asinine splash screen that demands your subserviance, your obedience to their demands on your personal behavior",screen
"Yes, their opening screen provides a button for you to click each time, saying you must AGREE to their WARNINGS, their terms of use, their demands about how you must drive your vehicle because you're probably too stupid to be responsible without their help",screen
I do like the wider touch screen but the speaker are damage in my unit or they are just made poorly,screen
"While we loved the larger screen and quality of display on the unit, there were a few concerns and problems which had us return it in favor of a tom tom: On our tom tom, it displayed the mileage left to the destination as well as the next turn",screen
The touch screen makes entering destinations very easy,screen
I had a different model Garmin unit for  about 6 months before this one  but then the touch screen started to malfunction and I had to return it,screen
The screen is big and graphics are awesome,screen
"Do not turn it on or off until it returns to the main screen* because that may cause your device to become inoperable""  Now they have my attention",screen
"the lane assist function as shown on the illustration is not a feature of this model, just a much less visible version of it in a 1*1 cm upper left corner of the screen",screen
"The screen is very easy to read, spoken directions including street names were excellent",screen
"Upon starting up, many times I would have to reset the screen brightness and make sure sound was turned on",screen
screen is bright in day,screen
"When she plugged it in and powered it on the screen read ""no maps available""",screen
Today it went to a white screen and I can't even turn it off,screen
"The only good thing about it is the large screen, but even it can look bad when viewed at much of an angle",screen
My ancient Mio is so much better than this unit is every single way except screen size,screen
The screen is big and readable,screen
It somehow knew that you were on the same road and continued tracking you on the screen accurately,screen
"The screen is a good size, readable",screen
The 5-inch screen really isn't any more usable than a 4,screen
"It's easy to use, it acquires satellites quickly, has a clear screen and good user interface",screen
"Traffic updates do not happen often, but you have to put up with advertizing that takes up an important part of the screen all the time",screen
